<h2>A BOY KNIGHT</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<h3>Cross-Roads</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was late November and a little snow
had fallen. Three boys were on their
way down Park Avenue to school&mdash;the
Regal High. One of the boys, Frank Mulvy,
carried his lunch in his pocket. He did not
live far away, but his mother was to be out for
the day and had put up a lunch for him. As
the boys came down the avenue, an old man
whom they had never seen before, met them.
He asked them for a few cents to get something
to eat. It happened that none of the
boys had any money. They told him so, and
passed on. The man gave them a searching
look and groaned.</div>

<p>When the boys had gone a block and turned
the corner at Gody's drug store, Frank Mulvy
made an excuse to loiter a moment, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>turning quickly, ran up the avenue. He overtook
the poor man and handing him the lunch
which he had in his pocket, said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I have no money, sir, but here
is something to eat."</p>

<p>"God bless you, boy," the old man sighed,
as he almost snatched the little package.</p>

<p>The boy had no lunch that day.</p>

<p>Frank Mulvy was fourteen years old. He
was a freshman at Regal, a member of the
football team and the secretary of the "Boy's
Club" attached to St. Leonard's Church.
The office was elective and Frank had been
chosen with hardly a dissenting vote.</p>

<p>The Club met three times a week in a large
room of the parish house where the boys,
about ninety in number, had a good library,
billiard tables, games of various kinds and
other attractions. Once a week the priest in
charge, Father Boone, gave them a little talk
on something of interest and profit to boys.
Usually these talks were very welcome to the
lads as Father Boone did not so much talk
virtue as illustrate it, and that not merely by
stories, but rather by his own way of saying
and doing things. The boys liked him.</p>

<p>Frank was Father Boone's right hand man,
and the director was glad that the boys had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
elected him secretary, although he had given
no indication of his preference. He allowed the
boys the greatest latitude and found <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'genererally'">generally</ins>
that they did the right thing. While
Father Boone would be the last to give it as
the cause, the fact was that they did the right
thing because he himself did. He always endeavored
to create an atmosphere of trust
and manliness. The morale of the Club was
proof that he had succeeded, for altogether
the boys were a fine set, and the director considered
that Frank was the best of the lot.</p>

<p>Father Boone was very liberal, but if he
once drew a line he never allowed it to be
crossed. The boys knew that. They used to
say, "Father Boone is all right but if he tells
you what to do, you'd better do it."</p>

<p>One day, just five weeks before Christmas,
Father Boone called Frank aside and said to
him:</p>

<p>"I have a bit of good news for you. A
friend who is interested in the work of the Club
has given me one hundred dollars to spend as
I like on you boys. You are all very fond of
music, and I am thinking of buying some fine
records for our victrola. What do you
say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank replied, "I guess it's all right, Father.
You know best what the boys want."</p>

<p>The priest added, "I have another plan also,
but I am not certain which to adopt. I was
thinking of taking the boys down to hear John
McCormack. We could get ninety seats together&mdash;it's
far ahead&mdash;and treat the crowd to
a ride both ways. How does that strike
you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good, Father," said Frank. "But,"
he continued, "suppose we put it up to the
fellows. Then you are sure to satisfy them."</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed the priest, "and now
you go ahead and put it to a vote."</p>

<p>It was surprising how short a time it took
to pass the word around. Soon every one
knew that something out of the ordinary
was up.</p>

<p>When the boys had assembled, Frank put
the matter before the Club, and all without
hesitation declared for John McCormack.
They had heard his records on the victrola,
and were desirous of seeing and hearing himself.
When Frank informed the director,
Father Boone said:</p>

<p>"That's all hunky dory," an expression he
used when he was well satisfied, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
committee which the boys had sent to thank
him for his kind thought appeared, he said:</p>

<p>"That's all right, boys; that's the best fun
I get, doing something for you fellows."</p>

<p>After that, McCormack's were the only
records to be heard in that club room. Every
boy played his favorite, time and again.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he sings much better than his
records," said Tommy Hefnan.</p>

<p>"Of course," retorted Dick Brian. "That is
foolish question four million and two."</p>

<p>"O! I don't know," said Tommy. "I
heard some records that were better than the
performer. You remember that war song we
had last year? Well, I heard his Nibbs himself
sing it at a vaudeville show, and I liked the
record better."</p>

<p>"Well, his Nibbs isn't McCormack," snapped
Dick, "and you'll see the difference when
you hear him."</p>

<p>So the boys were pretty well worked up
over the concert, and awaited it eagerly.
Most of them were in moderate circumstances
and the limit of their entertainment was the
movies. For them to see the great McCormack
was what in the old days it meant to the
country lads to see Barnum's Circus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>There were, as we have said, ninety boys in
the Club, from eleven to fifteen years of age.
When they got to sixteen, they were obliged to
drop membership, and were encouraged to
join the older boys' club, which admitted
those from sixteen to nineteen. Most of the
lads did that. In Father Boone's time, however,
the boys hated to leave the younger
club. It was amusing to see the growing youngsters
torn between two emotions. On the one
hand, every boy wanted to be big, to get closer
to manhood. On the other, he dreaded the
loss of the Club. For Father Boone certainly
made it a very desirable place. It was because
membership was so highly regarded that
he was able to set a high standard for his
boys and keep them up to it.</p>

<p>For every vacancy there was a score on the
waiting list. Every mother in the parish
wanted her boy to get into the Club. Frequently
the director would be stopped in the
street by a good mother who would say to
him, "Father, my boy Jimmie is one of the
best boys in the parish. Won't you please have
him in mind for the next vacancy?"</p>

<p>Now and then, however, a boy of the wrong
sort would get into the Club; one whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
nothing good seemed to affect. The boys
themselves usually took such a one in hand,
and made it pretty hot for him. They knew
that their own welfare depended on the general
conduct, and they took good care of it.</p>

<p>Bill Daly was what the boys called a "tough
nut." They nicknamed him "Bull." "Bull"
had got into the Club by the kind-heartedness
of Father Boone. His father was a drunkard
and his mother was a hard-working
woman. Bill was the only child. Father Boone
had got him a good job downtown and placed
him in the Club to help him along and to put
a little refinement in him. The boys knew that
he was Father Boone's ward, as it were, and
tolerated a lot from him, but Bill took the
consideration which he received as a sign of
his "pull," of his superiority over the others.
He was the oldest boy in the Club and different
from all the others. On several occasions a fist
fight was barely averted when he tried to
bully some smaller boy.</p>

<p>The boys never told Father Boone about
Bill,&mdash;first, because the director had let them
know that he did not want any tattling, and
secondly, because most of them felt sorry for
the fellow, and saw that his one chance for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
making something of himself was by remaining
in the Club. If they fancied that Father
Boone knew nothing about Bill, however,
they were much mistaken. In fact, there was
little going on that he did not know. But as
he said, "A man has to see a lot and yet not
see it." For reasons of his own, he saw and
yet did not see the doings of Bill.</p>

<p>When Frank Mulvy was elected secretary,
Bill had tried hard to get the place, but as
soon as he saw that the sentiment was all for
Frank, he joined in. Nevertheless, he had it
in for Frank. He was tired hearing the fellows
say "Frank this," and "Frank that." He
could not understand how, without trying for
it at all, Frank got the esteem and affection
of everybody.</p>

<p>One day Father Boone came into the Club
and announced that he wanted a very important
errand done and that he was going to
select a boy for it. Everybody thought Frank
was "it," and to the surprise of all, Bill was
chosen. He threw out his chest, gave a superior
look at the crowd, especially at Frank,
and received his commission. As soon as he was
gone, Father Boone called the boys together
and said, "I know you are surprised that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
am fooled in William Daly. I can see it in
your faces. Boys, I know all about him. I
have been on the point of discharging him
several times. But if he is sent out of this
Club, he will go to the devil. Of course I
know there is a limit. But in his case that
limit is going to be 'the limit.'"</p>

<p>Saying that, he left.</p>

<p>Frank immediately said to the crowd, "I
say, fellows, let's give Bill a show. He means
well. His home is a pretty bad place, and I
guess he is not half to blame." The boys
agreed with Frank.</p>

<p>When Bill returned, he came in swaggering
and going over to Frank, he said, "You
think you're the whole bunch, don't you?
Well, you see you're not. I'd punch you, you
stuck-up kid, if you were not the pet of the
Boss." Bill's language was as low as his
ideals.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Frank's face, his hands
tightened, his jaws set, and he was about to
resent the charge, when, recalling what Father
Boone had just said, he suddenly relaxed and
smiled. "That's all right, Bill; we'll be friends
yet."</p>

<p>Bill swaggered over to a set of boys at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
other end of the room, and said, loud enough
for all to hear, "A great kid, that Mulvy.
He don't know when he gets a slap in the
face. I just gave him a good one, but he takes
it like a sissie."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, 'Bull,' I want none of
your 'sissie,' do you understand?" Frank exclaimed,
his voice trembling.</p>

<p>"Who are you calling 'Bull,' little girl?"
roared Bill. "Another word and I'll smash
you."</p>

<p>The "sissie" and the "little girl" got under
Frank's skin. For a moment he neither saw
nor heard anything. He was ready to fight.
His blood tingled. But he gripped himself and
swallowed his retort just as Daly, mistaking
the silence for cowardice, rushed forward and
struck him a blow in the face. Like a flash,
the color came to Frank's face. He had gone
<i>the limit</i> and the lion in him was let loose. Any
fellow who had played football against Frank
would have known what that meant. With
set, determined face, speaking not a word, he
squared off.</p>

<p>"So you want to fight, do you, you doll?"
roared Daly.</p>

<p>Not a word from Frank. Instead, he held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his attitude of fight and approached his
tormentor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are pie for me, candy kid. I
could lick you with one hand. You'll never
want another fight when this is over."</p>

<p>Never a word from Frank. The crowd
made a circle. The whole thing happened
so suddenly that it was in full swing before
they knew it.</p>

<p>As Frank came up to Daly, the bully hauled
off and gave him a straight blow on the forehead.
It rang like a ball from a bat. It staggered
Frank. But he came right on. He did
not strike a blow, but simply stood up before
his opponent with arms at guard. Again
Daly launched a blow. This time it took
Frank on the top of the head. Bill was nearly
two years older than his opponent and much
taller and heavier. But Frank had grit. The
fellows said that they never knew anyone
who had so much "sand" as Mulvy. He
needed it now. Daly was infuriated. He
rushed at Frank hitting him on the head and
neck and chest. All of a sudden, without a
word, straight from the shoulder, Frank sent
a terrific jolt to Daly's jaw. He roared and
tore and threatened. Frank did not open his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mouth. He kept his eyes on Bill, and was cool
and firm. He waited for the next on-rush. It
came like a whirlwind. Bill crashed into him,
swinging blindly in his rage, hitting here and
there. Frank took his punishment and coolly
studied his opponent.</p>

<p>Bill rose on his toes to come down with a
swing on Frank's face. In an instant, while
Bill's face was completely unguarded, Frank
drove home a blow right on his nose. The
blood spurted and at the sight of it, both fighters
clinched and pounded as hard as they
could. Finally, in the struggle, Frank slipped
and fell. Immediately, Bill was on top of
him.</p>

<p>By this time, Bill realized that he was in a
fight. Frank's blows, though fewer, told effectively
and Bill began to fear that if the
fight went on, he might lose it. So, as he had
Frank under him, he yelled, "Do you give
up?" No reply. "Do you hear, do you give
up? I have given you enough. If you say you
are licked, I'll let up." Not a word from
Frank. Instead, he wriggled from under,
worked himself free, smashed Daly a fierce
blow on the ear, and another on the jaw. Bill
had all he could take and as they stood up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
again, face to face, the "Bull" and the "Girl"
paused, glaring at each other.</p>

<p>"I'll stop now if you will," muttered Bill.</p>

<p>"Do you take back what you said?"
shouted Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Bill.</p>

<p>"Am I a sissie?" demanded Frank.</p>

<p>"No," replied Bill.</p>

<p>"Shake," said Frank, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>They gripped hands. It was over. The
crowd got around Frank, patted him on the
back, and in various ways showed him their
approval. Daly, abandoned by everybody,
slunk away towards the door to make a hasty
exit. He knew he was done for. The Club
was no longer a place for him. He was disgraced,
"licked by a kid." But he would get
square. Leave that to him.</p>

<p>As he was about to open the door to go out,
Frank broke from the crowd and going
toward Bill, said: "Daly, you are not such a
bad fellow. You might have licked me if you
had wanted to keep it up. I say, let's be
friends."</p>

<p>"I'm no dude, I don't belong to your
'<i>bunch</i>,'" he retorted angrily, as he slammed
the door behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>Daly was angry with himself, with Mulvy,
with the Club, even with Father Boone. He
was desperate. Instead of going home, he
waited around the corner. He was boiling with
resentment. He must do something to square
things. After thinking awhile he decided to
try to "queer" the crowd with Father Boone
and break off the McCormack treat. But how
was he to do it? If he could only bring some
discredit on the Club, it would hurt the fellows
as well as Father Boone. That was it. He
acted quickly on the thought. Going back, he
waited on the opposite side of the street, in
the shadows, until the last light in the Club
was out. He knew a way of getting into the
building by a basement window, but when he
tried it, he found that it was locked. Fearing
that someone might still be within, he withdrew
to the opposite side of the street again
and waited a half hour. When he was certain
that there was nobody in the Club, he crossed
over and tried one window after another.
All were locked. He turned to the door under
the front steps. It was bolted, as usual.
Looking up to the story above, he saw a window
slightly opened. But it was too high for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him to reach. Just then, a policeman came
along. Bill heard his steps and concealed himself
in the areaway. He began to reflect that
he was taking a risk. "Suppose the cop caught
me," he said to himself. But his resentment
was greater than his caution, and so he kept
at his design.</p>

<p>He figured that by a long reach from the railing
of the steps to the window sill, he might
get a hold and enter. Up he leaped to the railing,
and by a supreme effort, clinched the
window sill and swung over. It took him but
a minute to open the window and enter. Once
in, he went straight to the room where the
fight had occurred. He threw everything
about in disorder, broke several chairs, threw
down two large pictures from the wall, overturned
the victrola and records and made the
place look like the scene of a mob fight. He
then went upstairs to the library, threw the
books around, damaged some, overturned a
desk, upset a table and spilled ink on the
floor. "I guess that's enough for one round,"
he said, and cautiously went to the window
and got out unobserved.</p>

<p>Next morning when the janitor came to set
things in order, he scarcely believed his eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as he looked upon the wreckage before him.
He straightway went to Father Boone.</p>

<p>"Impossible, my good man!" the director
exclaimed. "You must be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," he replied, "and you may
be mistaken too when you see it."</p>

<p>The janitor was so agitated and vehement
that the priest went over to the Club rooms to
see for himself. There it was. Worse, in fact,
than the janitor had described. What did it
mean? His boys! St. Leonard's Boys' Club!
With the instinct which was part of his nature,
he divined at once that this was an enemy act.
Who the enemy was, what his motive, he
could not say. But his instinct told him it was
not his boys. He told the janitor to put
everything in order. He sent for the carpenter
to mend the chairs and tables and hang the
pictures. He himself got some acid and removed
the inkstains from the floor. The Club
was never occupied except evenings, and by
the time it was open, everything was in ship-shape.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(III)</div>

<p>That night as the boys came in, in twos and
threes, they talked over the fight, and what
they were to do in regard to Daly. Of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not one of them suspected that anything had
occurred after they left. When Frank came in,
they gave him a cheer. He was now the official
and popular head of the crowd. He had won
his leadership last night by the means most
admired by boys, courage and generosity, and
he took his honors modestly.</p>

<p>After talking on various phases of the fight,
the crowd turned to Frank, who as yet had
said nothing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man? Why are
you so glum?"</p>

<p>"O, nothing," answered Frank.</p>

<p>They went about their evening's amusements,
some to play billiards, some to read,
and some to hear the victrola, but they generally
returned to talk over the events of the
previous evening. Frank sat silent and
moody. Soon Dick Brian came up to him.
Dick was what you would call a little <i>man</i>.
He was quiet, thoughtful, affectionate and
very wise. Frank and Dick were close friends.
Dick thought that Frank was the finest boy
in the world, and Frank had intense admiration
for Dick's fearlessness and candor.</p>

<p>"Well Frank, what's up?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"O, is that you, Dickie boy?" replied Frank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, but you are not you," answered
Dick. "What's the matter? I guess
I know."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"You are worried over the 'Bull' and the
racket," whispered Dick.</p>

<p>"Put it there, kid," replied Frank, extending
his hand. "You are a wise lad, you struck
it right."</p>

<p>Dick was two years younger than Frank,
but he had an old head. That made them confidants.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs, Dick, I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>Alone with Dick in the secretary's room,
Frank began:</p>

<p>"Father Boone will be here soon. I don't
know just how to act. If I considered myself
only, it would be easy. I'd go and make a clean
breast of the whole affair. But there is Daly,
and the crowd. I know that Father Boone is
tolerating a lot from Bill because he has hopes
of setting him right. It'll be an awful blow to
him if he knows that the crowd is down on Bill
and that the secretary was the cause of it.
I know you'll say that I'm not the cause of it,
that I did only what any fellow would do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
But we fellows of the Club aren't just any
fellows. A whole lot's been done for us, extra.
And especially for me. I got all that last
night, before I struck back. But gee, I lost my
head when he called me a girl, and simply had
to fight. I kept thinking of it all last night
and what Father Boone'd say. Not that he
minds a fight. You remember on the outing
last month, two fellows had a scrap. He just
said, 'It's better to let the bad blood out than
to keep it in.' He didn't even ask who they
were. And he never wants any tattling either.
That is why I feel this affair so much, and
also because Daly is concerned. Father Boone
is so terribly decent with us that I just hate to
think he will be disappointed in any of us, and
that I couldn't take Daly's slurs and laugh
them off."</p>

<p>"You big boob," put in Dick after listening
gravely to all. "You'd be just what he called
you if you did that."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," repeated Frank, "but I
feel terribly sore about the whole thing."</p>

<p>"Take my advice, Frank, go direct to
Father Boone when he comes in, and tell him
the whole thing from A to Z. He'll understand.
Besides, I'll bet a hat he knows it already."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope he does," added Frank.</p>

<p>They went down to the crowd which was
now all together. The fellows did not expect
to see Daly, but some of them thought that
he might show up to brave it out. When
Father Boone came in, smiling as usual, a
word for this lad, and that, a tap for Jack and
a handshake for Tommy and Willie and John,
no one would ever have suspected that he
knew anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Generally on entering, after greeting the
boys, he went to his office and straightened
out the details of the preceding day. After
that he would circulate among the boys, asking
one if his father got the job he recommended
him to, another how his mother was,
a third what his marks were for the last school
month, and so on. He knew them all, and all
about them. He was their big brother. In his
presence there was no restraint. He knew
them so well, and they understood him so well,
that he was like one of them. If a dispute were
on, and he came in, it went on just the same.
He knew boys and loved them, and they realized
it.</p>

<p>He was wise enough to know that boys are
boys. That was the secret of his success. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
result was that he could do anything with
them. A word from him and they would leave
off what most pleased them. A suggestion
from him and they would do what was hardest
and ordinarily most disagreeable. Very kind
he was, also firm as a rock. And they knew it.
He never went back on his word, as they knew
by experience. The consequence was that
with very few words, he accomplished what he
wanted done.</p>

<p>This evening he looked around at the crowd.
There was something the matter. That was
evident. He knew he could find out by asking
but he never did that. He began now to observe.
There was a restraint evident among
the boys. That was unusual. Not so much
hilarity. He ran his eye over the crowd. He
could see at a glance, just who was and who
was not present. Daly was always conspicuous,
because he was so noisy, but Daly was
not among those present tonight. Usually the
boys were scattered, some in one room, some
in another. Not so tonight. They were all in
the same room. Generally they were interested
in the games. Tonight they seemed to
be interested in him. Putting things together,
he concluded that the crowd as a crowd was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the mix-up, and that the boys were on the
lookout for something to happen. Frank sat
off in a corner looking pensive. That was not
his way.</p>

<p>Poor Frank was in torture. He was hoping
that Father Boone would go upstairs so that
he could follow him and explain matters.</p>

<p>And Father Boone was hurt because no one
volunteered an explanation. Surely Frank
would say a word. But no, no one at all made
any reference to the wreckage of the night
before.</p>

<p>"Why don't they speak up? They're all
concerned in it. It isn't a case of being an
informer. They know I don't want tattlers
around. But this is different. This is a serious
matter. Damage was done. It is a question
of justice. And they know my mind on
that. And that secretary owes me a report.
He is an official. I've told them often enough
that when an official reports matters pertaining
to his office, it is not 'squealing,' but duty.
They all understand that; Frank especially.
Well, I'll wait here fifteen minutes longer, and
if they don't explain, I'll take action."</p>

<p>Father Boone went upstairs and after fifteen
minutes left, in a very sober mood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>It was some minutes later that Frank,
thinking the director was upstairs, went up to
open his heart to him. But Father Boone was
not in his office. Frank descended to the
"gym," stayed awhile and then went home.
He had a bad headache. The night before he
had not slept. He could not eat. When he got
home, however, he decided to get the thing off
his mind before going to bed, and tired as he
was, he started back to the Club, hoping to
find Father Boone. But the priest had not returned.
Hesitating a moment, he finally decided
to go to the rectory and have it all over
with. But at the rectory they told him that
Father Boone was out on a sick call and might
not be back for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>"Well, I've done my part," said Frank, and
back home he went, somewhat relieved.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IV)</div>

<p>Next night, Father Boone came into the
Club not looking as pleasant as usual. He
came late, too; not his wont. He greeted few,
and his face showed firm. The boys whispered
one to another, "He's on."</p>

<p>Frank now felt that he was a culprit. Something
told him that Father Boone knew the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whole matter and that he was cut up because
Daly was concerned. It was too late now to
go to him and make a clean breast of it. What
must Father Boone think of him for driving
Daly out of the Club. Forgetting all his efforts
to do the right thing, Frank saw only
that Father Boone was offended. He blamed
himself as the cause of it and gloomily admitted
that he had not been man enough to
inform the director. That hurt him. Once
more, when the priest went up to his office
after a few minutes stay with the boys, Frank
was determined to go to him and take the
consequence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Father Boone had come to a
decision. There had been some rowdyism in
the Club. Furniture was broken, serious damage
was done. It certainly was the work of
more than one or two. By their very attitude,
the boys showed their guilt. Yet no one, not
even the secretary, had explained. Taking
down a large sheet of paper, the director wrote
on it in big letters,</p>

<div class='center'>
"The McCormack treat is off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;"><span class="smcap">Jerome Boone</span>."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Pressing a button, he summoned Frank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
As Frank heard the bell, a lump formed in his
throat. He felt sure that every fellow in the
room could see how his knees shook. But he
was glad, in a way, that matters were coming
to a head. He expected that Father Boone
would give him a good scolding and that that
would settle it. He was all prepared for the
interview, but was not admitting, even to himself,
how near the tears were to flowing.</p>

<p>As Frank approached the desk, Father
Boone was writing. Frank hoped he would not
look up, and as he stood there for a second, it
seemed an hour. Then, without pausing or
turning toward Frank, Father Boone said in
a low, measured voice: "Take that notice,
Mulvy, and put it up on the board below."
That was all. Frank stood perfectly still for a
moment, clutching the jamb of the door while
Father Boone went on writing. If the director
had turned but a little, he would have seen
agony and anguish in Frank's face, and he
would have understood. But he kept on writing
and Frank remained standing, unable to
move a step.</p>

<p>Then a hard feeling crept into the boy's
heart. He felt that he was being dealt with
unjustly, that he was condemned unheard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Every bit of his pride came to the top and the
boy who, a few seconds before, was ready to
blame himself for Father Boone's disappointment,
now would not have yielded an inch.
Father Boone was Frank's ideal. He thought
more of him than of anyone outside his own
family. But suddenly he saw the priest as a
hard-hearted and unjust man. For the moment
he was glad to find that he was in an
out-and-out struggle. "No explanations now,"
he reflected, "time for all that is past." The
director had not given him a chance to do the
right thing and now he, too, would show his
mettle.</p>

<p>There was an air of defiance about Frank
as he walked down the stairs and posted the
notice on the board.</p>

<p>The crowd gathered quickly. As they read
the brief lines on the notice-board, the wave
of disappointment that passed over them
could almost be felt in the air.</p>

<p>Of course the boys had told their parents
of the McCormack treat and now it was off.
That meant explanations. They usually kept
the Club's affairs entirely to themselves, but
the McCormack affair was altogether different&mdash;good
news to those at home. How could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
they explain why it was off? Everybody knew
that Father Boone never made promises without
fulfilling them. Now every mother and
sister and&mdash;yes&mdash;every father would want to
know why this treat was cancelled. These and
other things ran through the boys' minds.
But, above all, the sentiment most keenly felt
was regret that Father Boone had had to take
such action. They knew he was even more
delighted to do them a kindness than they
were to receive one. Dick Brian expressed the
feeling of the crowd when he said: "Gee, it's
tough on us, but it's worse on Father Boone."</p>

<p>Frank heard the comments with a cynical
smile. He said not a word, but was rather
pale. One of the lads inquired of him, "How
did Father Boone find it out?"</p>

<p>"Search me!" Frank replied.</p>

<p>"I say," whispered another, "I'll bet 'Bull'
squealed to get square with the crowd."</p>

<p>Tommy Hefnan edged up to Dick. "What's
up, anyway? Father Boone never did anything
before if the fellows scrapped. He usually
let them have it out and appeared not to
know about it. What's up now that he is
soaking the whole crowd for this scrap?"</p>

<p>"Search me!" answered Dick. "The only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
line I can get on it is there's something else
that we don't know. We've got to take our
medicine, of course, and you can be sure
Father Boone knows what he's doing. If there
is anything wrong, it's somewhere else."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," echoed Tommy as he
sauntered off.</p>

<p>Frank and Dick lived near each other and
generally went home together. That night,
Frank tried hard to assume indifference, but
wise Dick saw through the disguise and finally
asked him point blank, if he did not feel
cut up over the affair.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Frank almost yelled, in
reply. "It's not a square deal. If Father
Boone has anything against us, why doesn't
he come out with it, and not hit blindly and
in the dark?"</p>

<p>"Well, I get what you're aiming at," answered
Dick, "but you know, Frank, that
Father Boone is the squarest man going. He
knows what he's doing, and there's a reason.
I'll stand by him, no matter what happens."</p>

<p>This cut Frank like a knife. He knew Dick
was manly and wise. He also realized that
every word he said was true. Nevertheless,
he felt like punching him for saying it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the way, they walked on in
silence, until they came to parting, when
Frank abruptly put out his hand and said,
"You're all right, Dick." Then, as the
younger boy turned the corner, Frank reflected:</p>

<p>"Yes, he's all right. The kid has more balance
than I have."</p>

<p>At the door of the Mulvy apartment,
Frank met his mother. She saw at once that
whatever was troubling her boy, was even
worse tonight than it had been before. Then
she had said nothing but tonight she was
truly alarmed at Frank's pallor.</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth is the matter, dear?"
she exclaimed, as he entered the room. "You
are as white as a sheet and trembling all
over." As she spoke she put her arms around
him and gave him that silent sympathy
which only a mother can impart. That was the
one thing Frank could not resist. He could
fight anything but kindness. At his mother's
gentle pressure, his eyes filled and for a moment
he could not answer. His words were all
choked back by strange sounds in his throat,
but his mother waited and presently, when
he was sufficiently composed, the whole story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
came tumbling out. He told his mother all
that had happened. He omitted nothing. For
a while she made no comment. Then with the
tenderness of a mother who knows her boy,
she said,</p>

<p>"Frank, you've done nothing to be ashamed
of. There's more to that affair, I'm sure. And
above all, Father Boone does not act rashly.
Remember now, mother says so."</p>

<p>Frank felt a weight lifted from his heart.
He went to his room, knelt down at his bedside,
under the crucifix hanging from the wall,
and making an act of contrition for his faults
of the day, asked God to give him the grace
to do right always. Then turning to a little
shrine at the head of the bed, where a large
picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was hung,
he said, "O Heart wounded for me, give me
strength to bear this hurt for love of Thee."</p>

<p>He arose, feeling that he had offered something
to our Lord. That brought peace to his
soul and a few minutes later he was fast asleep.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(V)</div>

<p>By the time Frank was ready for breakfast
next morning, Mrs. Mulvy had made up
her mind to see Father Boone and find out
what the trouble was. She was certain that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there was something back of it all. She knew
Father Boone, and she knew Frank, and
further, she knew how they esteemed each
other. Father Boone had often stopped her
in the street to tell her what a fine boy Frank
was. And Frank was never tired talking about
Father Boone, admiring him for this and for
that, but mainly for himself.</p>

<p>Nothing was said by mother or son on the
important topic until Frank was leaving the
house to go to school. Then, as he kissed her,
he said, "Mother, I want you to promise me
something."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear."</p>

<p>"Remember now, it's a promise."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Frank."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I want you to promise that
you won't say anything about what I've told
you and that you will not let Father Boone
know I told you. Even if you should meet him
<i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accidently'">accidentally</ins></i>," he said slyly, "you are not to let
on."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"You promised, Mother. It's too late now
to consider," he urged.</p>

<p>"Well, just as you say, dear," she answered.
And she felt that perhaps it was better to let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the matter adjust itself, after all. "True love
never runs smoothly," she mused, "and I am
sure Father Boone and Frank are very fond of
each other."</p>

<p>When Frank got back to school and mingled
with the boys, the peace of the night before
and his mother's assurances all seemed to
vanish. He could not see any justice in the
way Father Boone had acted.</p>

<p>"It was entirely unfair," he kept thinking.
"The whole thing was out of measure with the
fault. After all, a scrap is a scrap. Lots of fellows
fight and make up and it's all over. I
made up with Daly, or at least I tried to. Why
should the crowd be punished for one or two?
I know what I'll do. I'll go straight to Father
Boone this evening and tell him the whole
thing. Then if he wants to, he can punish me,
not the whole crowd."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in his room at the rectory,
Father Boone too was considering the same
subject. "Boys are not ingrates, as a rule," he
reflected. "True, they may be thoughtless
and impulsive, but I have generally found
them appreciative. But there is Mulvy,&mdash;straight
and open as he usually is,&mdash;and he
hasn't offered a word of explanation. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his chance, when I sent for him to post that
notice but&mdash;not a word. And he surely saw I
was indignant. It's not like him. What can it
be? Is he afraid of the crowd? Hardly. But I
can't get away from that wholesale disorder
and breakage&mdash;the work of a mob. Those
boys seem to care for me&mdash;but&mdash;they know
how this kind of thing affects me. They've
had two days to reflect. Not one boy to say a
word! It is not the thing in itself that I care
about. There's a big bill for damages, but I
don't give a fig for that. It's the principle back
of it all. Here&mdash;all these years, I've been holding
up high standards to them and they fall
down just when they should stand erect. I
hated to call off that McCormack treat, but&mdash;what
could I do? Well, I'll have to see it
through now." And at that he set his jaws,
and it was easy to realize that he would see it
through.</p>

<p>He had hardly finished his musings when the
rectory door-man came to his room and said
that a young man was below to see him. He
went down and found Dick Brian awaiting
him. It was not Father Boone's nature to be
at odds with any one, and so when he came
upon Dick thus unexpectedly, forgetting for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the instant that war was on between him
and the club boys, he saluted the lad wholeheartedly.
The next instant, recollecting that
there was a hostile camp to deal with, he
quickly tightened up and said, "Well, my
boy, what is it?"</p>

<p>Dick, though ordinarily very self-possessed,
was not quite composed under the circumstances.
He summoned as much calm as he
could and said, "I have come, Father, to say
that there must be some mistake. The boys
would not do anything to displease you. It's
not the McCormack treat that they are thinking
about. It's you. Of course, they feel sore
that it is off, but they can stand that, but we
don't want you to feel that we are not grateful."</p>

<p>It was quite a speech even for Dick, but he
got it out and every word rang true. The
director realized it, which only increased the
mystery. "If the boys were so considerate
of him," he reflected, "why did they not explain?
They should know that he would do
what was right in the matter. If there were
any allowances to be made, they ought to know
that he would make them. It was not as if it
were an individual affair. The whole Club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was in question. A riot had occurred. And
just because the boys knew he never went
about prying into things he had a right to
expect a full explanation. But Dick's speech
didn't explain."</p>

<p>Father Boone's next remark was true to his
principle of not asking for information in such
cases. "And is there anything else you wish
to say?" Poor Dick! That took his breath
away. He stood silent for a moment and when
the priest turned to leave, he picked up his
hat and started for the door. But just at that
moment something&mdash;was it the suggestion of
a trembling lip in the last glimpse he had of
Dick's face, or just his own kind instincts that
made Father Boone turn back?</p>

<p>"I thank you, little man," he said, "for
coming to say to me what you did. I <i>am</i> put
out by this affair and I don't know yet what
to think of it. At any rate, Dick, you did the
right thing in coming here." So saying, he
opened the door for the lad, who went out
not knowing just what to make of it all.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VI)</div>

<p>On the same evening Dick met Frank on
the way down to the Club. He began at once:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, Frank, Father Boone is terribly
cut up over this thing. Do you know what I
think? Something or somebody has set him
wrong. It is not his way to take on so about
a scrap that he didn't even see. I tell you,
old man, I believe that 'Bull' has got in some
dirty work. He has not been around for two
days, and how do we know what he may have
told Father Boone?"</p>

<p>"Wise guy you are, kid. I have been wondering
myself, but I was too stupid to reason
out any kind of explanation. I'd not be surprised
if you have it right. At any rate, I
guess I'll try to see Father Boone tonight and
have it out. I should have done it before, but
I got my back up when he ignored me, and
became as stiff as he was stout."</p>

<p>When they reached the Club, the fellows
were all sitting around discussing the matter
in groups. The Club was not itself, that was
clear. As Frank and Dick entered, Tommy
Hefnan exclaimed, "Say, fellows, let's send
a committee to Father Boone. Let's elect a
committee to go and straighten out the fuss."</p>

<p>To this some of the boys objected, maintaining
that it looked like weakness. Others
said that it might seem as if they were doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it to get the McCormack treat back. To this
one of the older lads rejoined, "Let us tell him
before we begin, that we know the treat is off
and that although we regret it, we regret
something else much more."</p>

<p>"That's not half bad," echoed several.</p>

<p>"And it's the truth, too," muttered Tommy.</p>

<p>There it was again&mdash;in plain words. What
really worried every boy in the Club was the
fact that somehow, they had disappointed
Father Boone. Every fellow there owed him
something for special favors in addition to all
he had done for the crowd as a whole. And
every fellow knew that the very best way to
pay Father Boone back, was to be the kind of
boy that the director wanted him to be.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Everybody was too
devoted to Father Boone to deliberately
ignore one of his very strongest principles&mdash;"<i>the
tell-tale is not a man of honour</i>"&mdash;and of
all the crowd only two had a right to speak,
because only two had actually taken part in
the fight. Frank had tried to see Father
Boone, without success thus far&mdash;and Bill
evidently was steering clear of the affair.</p>

<p>Even then, why should a scrap cause the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
director such great worry&mdash;they thought&mdash;unless
he was angry because it had happened
right after what he had said about Bill, and
had resulted in his leaving the Club. As for
Frank&mdash;well, every boy knew that he would
do the same himself under the circumstances.</p>

<p>As for Father Boone, the more he thought
of the whole affair, the more he was sure of
his first decision. It was a free fight in which
most of the boys had had some part; only
Frank deserved special censure because he
had failed in his official capacity. By now the
director was beginning to be concerned about
Daly who had not appeared at the Club since
the disorder. He did not want the boy to get
away from his influence and so decided to call
at his home.</p>

<p>While the boys were discussing the advisability
of sending a committee to the director,
he was on his way to Daly's house. When he
got there, he was met at the door by Mrs.
Daly. She was a large slovenly woman. The
home was like herself. It was on the top
floor of a side street tenement. A dark and
crooked stairs led up to it. Father Boone
reflected that some people were like that stairway,
and when he reached the top floor and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
saw before him Bill Daly's mother, he thought
that poor Bill was to be pitied more than anything
else. "I must hold on to that boy if
possible," he mused. "After all, it's not they
who are well who need the physician, but they
who are ill."</p>

<p>Mrs. Daly conducted him into a dirty room.
He was asked to please pass through to the
parlor. Groping his way through two dark
bed-rooms, with no light or ventilation except
from a small window opening upon a
shaft, he came to the parlor. Apparently, it
was more of a clothes room than anything
else. On the couch, which was a bed at night,
on the table, and on the chairs were articles
of wearing apparel. Father Boone had to remove
an armful of assorted garments from
a chair to get a seat. His hostess was not at all
concerned. It was her normal surroundings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Daly was glad to see the priest. Her
heart was good and her religion meant something
to her in spite of everything. But she
was dragged down by conditions, like many
another. Some natures are superior to environment.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Hers'">Her's</ins> was not.</p>

<p>"And how is Mr. Daly?" began the priest.</p>

<p>"Drinking as usual," she replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's a great cross," he continued,
"but I hope a turn for the better will come,
some time."</p>

<p>"I hope it comes before it's too late," she
sighed. "He has all of us nearly as bad as
himself with his ways. He drinks his money
and leaves nothing for the home, but what
Willie brings in. God bless you, Father, for
the job you got Willie. It is the only steady
money that comes in."</p>

<p>"How is William?" asked the priest. "I've
missed him from the Club the last few days,
so I have just dropped in to see how he is; I
hope he is a good boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie is a good enough boy, he might
be worse," answered Bill's mother. "His
father sets him no good example, and the poor
boy has to put up with a lot of abuse. The
wonder is that he is any good at all."</p>

<p>She wiped her face with her apron, and sat
down on the edge of a chair. She was evidently
in a mood to talk. The kindliness of
the priest seemed to invite her confidence, for
she began:</p>

<p>"Mike was a good man before the drink got
him. We had our nice little home and his wages
came in as regular as Saturday night. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
went to church together every Sunday morning
and God was good to us. But when Willie
was about six years old, his father got a job
over at King's automobile place. He was
ambitious and started in and learned how to
drive a taxi. He was out day and night. His
money came in fast, and he was good to me
and Willie.</p>

<p>"At first, everything went all right, and I
thanked God. But soon, he began to leave off
Church on Sunday from time to time. After
a while, he dropped it entirely. Then he got
in with a bad set. It was not long before he
came home under the influence. I cried before
him and begged him to let the liquor alone. He
did for a while, but he began again and kept
it up. Then he lost his job. He got another
easy enough but he kept at the drink. And
then he began to hold back his money. And
it wasn't everyday that we had something in
the house to eat. I had to sell things from
the house to buy food. If I didn't, he would
come home drunk and start a fight. And when
there was nothing more to sell he began to
beat me. If Willie cried, he beat him. The
poor boy was often black and blue. Things
went on from bad to worse. I had to have him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
arrested, although it broke my heart. It was
a disgrace to us all. Willie was ashamed to go
out and play with the other boys. One day
as he was going along the street, two boys
yelled at him and called his father bad names.
Willie liked his dad, even if he was in jail, because
he knew what a good father he was
once.</p>

<p>"When the boys yelled at Willie, he got
afraid and ran. But they ran after him. I suppose
if he stood, they wouldn't have chased
him. They caught him and beat him. He tried
to get away and then he struck out. You see,
Father, Willie was a big boy for his age, and
very strong. He takes after me. But he never
knew his strength. Well, this time he just
struck out. He knocked one of the boys
down, gave another a fine black eye, and both
of them took to their heels. It soon got around
that my Willie was a terror. All the boys got
afraid of him. He had his own way after that
in every gang, and he got into a lot of scrapes,
but he was always good to his mother.</p>

<p>"When his father got out of jail, he was
surprised to see the difference in Willie. Well,
to make a long story short, the father has
been drinking ever since, and that's nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
eight years ago, and my heart is broken. If
it were not for little Willie, I don't know what
I'd do."</p>

<p>The priest was a good listener. Although
this was but another of the many similar stories
which he had heard, there was something
pathetic in the mother's pride, and in her love
of Willie.</p>

<p>The home explained itself now. Poor
woman. Discouraged and without sufficient
means, she had drifted and the home had
drifted with her, and Willie too.</p>

<p>Just then footsteps were heard, and as the
door opened Bill stood there. He was amazed
on seeing the priest. It flashed on him that he
was found out but he didn't want his mother
to know. He made a sign to the priest to say
nothing for the present. Father Boone understood
it at once and was glad to see this consideration
of the boy for his mother, although
it didn't tell him how much Bill knew of the
Club mystery.</p>

<p>Daly was a shrewd lad, and after his mother
withdrew, he kept his composure. He had to
find out first how much the priest knew. Was
it just the fight he came to see about or the
wreckage? And how could he handle it so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
even if everything came out, Father Boone
would not cause him the loss of the job he had
got him? Bill decided to fence as cleverly as
possible and not tell a bit more than he had
to. The priest began.</p>

<p>"Well, William, I hope you are not ill.
I've missed you from the Club the past few
nights?"</p>

<p>"O, I'm all right," answered Bill.</p>

<p>"Have you any reason for staying away?"
asked the priest. There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"He is fishing," thought Bill.</p>

<p>Father Boone looked him steadily in the
eye and repeated, "I asked you, Willie, if
there was any reason for your staying away?"</p>

<p>"Better ask Mulvy," Bill replied, with a
grin.</p>

<p>Father Boone's heart sank. He wanted to
clear Frank&mdash;and everybody else&mdash;but here
was the secretary's name again. Bill's answer
and his manner both implied that Frank was
in the affair deeper than the director had
even suspected.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said aloud, "I shall not be
disappointed in you, William. No matter
what has happened, I want you to continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the Club." With that he took his departure.
But as he left the house he reflected
that if William Daly ever got away from his
influence, he might go down hill fast. There
was one thing that gave him hope, and that
was the boy's love for his mother. He knew
that a boy who was so fond of his mother
had something to work on.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VII)</div>

<p>Down the dark and crooked stairs Father
Boone made his way. When he got to the
street floor and opened the door and took in
the clear sunlight, he thought, "Will this
dark passage of mind in which I find myself
terminate in a clear understanding?" While
going along he reflected that so far every step
had only led into darker ways. He had tried
to convince himself that Frank was not cognizant
of the mischief. He could not understand
how such a boy would fail him. He felt
as mean for himself as he did for Frank. To
be so utterly deceived in a boy! Frank should
have reported it, even though he had no part
in it. Decision and consequences should be
left to the director of the Club.</p>

<p>When Frank had taken office, it was made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
clear to him that the secretary as an officer
was obliged to keep the director informed
concerning matters of importance. This
wreckage was a matter of the greatest importance.
It had taken him a whole day to
restore the place and had cost him no small
sum of money. Besides, it was not only that;
the breakage indicated a big disturbance.
There had been a free fight, evidently, and
bad blood. Perhaps there was a division in the
Club. It was Mulvy's business to report the
affair and leave the rest to the director. He
failed to do so. That in itself, in a boy like
him, was worse by far than a dozen fights.</p>

<p>Every thing tended to convince Father
Boone that Frank had taken a false step. In
this indignant mood, he reached the Club
about half an hour before closing time. The
boys were waiting for him. He was hardly
seated in his office, when he heard a knock at
the door. Looking up he saw three boys before
him. "Well?" said Father Boone sternly,
for by now he was in a fighting mood. The
committee consisted of Frank, Dick and Tommy.
Frank was spokesman.</p>

<p>"We have come, please, Father, in regard
to the trouble in the Club. We have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
chosen as a committee to see you about it.
We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." He got no further.</p>

<p>"We!" shouted the director. "We! Is this
committee secretary of the Club or are you?&mdash;you
sir, Frank Mulvy. Here it is the third day
since the disgraceful affair occurred and you&mdash;you
sir, Mr. Frank Mulvy, Secretary, have
kept me in the dark on a matter that it was
your official duty to report! Do you understand,
sir! that you are the secretary of this
Club; and you have duties as well as privileges?"</p>

<p>Poor Frank! If some one had struck him a
blow between the eyes, he could not have
been half so stunned. He had to exert all his
power to master his feelings. He tried to
speak. His throat refused to let the words
out. Was he to go away again misunderstood?
Was he to have the agony of it all
over again? He was helpless, speechless.
And there sat the director, indignant and angry.</p>

<p>While Frank was trying to get himself
together, the director arose, dismissed them,
and left his room and the Club.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VIII)</div>

<p>After the interview, if such it could be
called, the committee went back to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
crowd. On the way downstairs, Dick turned
to the spokesman. "Why didn't you speak
up, Frank?" Frank's soul at that moment
was on fire.</p>

<p>"Speak up?" he fairly yelled, "and what
were you 'boobs' doing? Why didn't you
back me up! You stood there like dummies.
You'd think we were culprits the way he
sailed into us. And neither of you opened
your mouths."</p>

<p>"That was your job," retorted Dick,
"and you got cold feet as soon as he looked
at you. I thought you had more sand."</p>

<p>"Sand!" echoed Frank, "maybe you'd do
better. Didn't you have your chance yesterday
at the rectory? And you said
yourself that you went out of the place like
a sheep. Don't talk to me about 'sand'.
You know yourself it's not lack of courage,
either on your part or mine. I could face
any one else and have it out. But when I
saw his face, and heard his voice, I just
wilted. You can't fight a man that's already
wounded. The thing is hurting him worse
than it hurts us. But I'll be blamed if I
know what's up. It's more than that scrap
we had, I'm sure of that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time they were down with the
rest of the boys.</p>

<p>"Well?" they exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p>"It's all up," said Frank. "He wouldn't
even listen to us. He gave me an awful
roast."</p>

<p>"Gosh, fellows, it's tough," added Dick.
"You should have seen the way he fired at
us. Before we caught our breath, he up and
left. We stood stock still for a moment, and
didn't know where we were."</p>

<p>"It seems," said Frank, "that he is terribly
put out because I did not officially
report the matter."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd think there was a robbery
or a murder or something like that, the way
you fellows talk," said Ned Mullen. "A
scrap is a scrap, and that's all there is to it,"
he added, "and I don't see the reason for all
this fuss, except it may be because he is
angry that an official was in it."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and, as the
crowd seemed to concur with him, he continued,
"I say, Frank, why don't you write him
a note? He can't fire at that, nor run away
from it. If you write the note, I'll take it to
him, or if you don't like that, mail it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The proposal struck the fellows as sensible
and practicable. Frank agreed to have the
note ready by the next night and to read it
to the crowd before sending it. After a little
further talk, they wound up the evening and
started for home.</p>

<p>As Ned was going out, Frank signalled him
to hang back a little. He gave the same hint
to Dick. In a few minutes the three were
together, Frank, Dick and Ned.</p>

<p>Ned Mullen was one of the smallest boys
of the Club. He was a bundle of nerves and
laughter. Wherever Ned was, there was
mirth. Everybody liked him. These three
were close friends. They were three of a kind.
Ned had won his class-medal three years in
succession. Dick was always first or second
in his class, and besides he had had the great
distinction of winning the diocesan gold
medal for the best English essay. Frank had
led his class as far back as the boys could
remember.</p>

<p>When they were alone, Frank said to Ned,
"Well, little bright eyes, you've certainly
saved the situation. I was just about desperate
when you 'butted in.' I had made
up my mind to resign and clear out altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
But I guess if Father Boone gets our
explanation, it will fix things all right."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go to him in the beginning,
Frank?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I did, kid, but I got cold feet." And then
he told Dick and Ned all that had occurred
from the start.</p>

<p>"There's more to it than appears," suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>"You said it," added Ned, and then continued,
"I never saw Father Boone like
this before. The fellows have got into lots
of worse scrapes than this, and he only
laughed. Why, you remember that day in
the woods last month, on the outing. Do
you suppose he didn't know all about that
fight between Barry and Dolan? And he
never said a word. Except about a week
after, if you noticed, he wanted two boys to
go on an errand to Bailey's and he sent them.
It turned out that they had to help at putting
on labels for the Hospital Fair and Mrs.
Bailey gave them a dollar each. They came
back chums. Father Boone doesn't 'grouch'
or snarl if a fellow breaks out. He just says
nothing, or else mends matters quietly in
his own way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, Ned, that's quite a speech," exclaimed
Dick, a bit envious. "You ought to
have been on that committee."</p>

<p>At that "Bright Eyes" chuckled and soon
he had the others laughing.</p>

<p>After a moment Frank announced, "I
want you fellows to help me out with this
note. I never did anything like it before.
I've written lots of compositions. But this is
diplomatic work."</p>

<p>Ned tapped his forehead and took on a
look of deep thought. Dick coughed and
struck the attitude of a thinker.</p>

<p>"O, laugh if you like, but if you had been
through what I have, you wouldn't think it
was a joke," muttered Frank.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want us to do?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"Put our heads together and send the
right kind of note," answered Frank.</p>

<p>"I say," suggested Dick, "suppose we each
write a note and the one that's best, goes."</p>

<p>"Good idea," replied Frank, "and let's
do it now, right here."</p>

<p>So they sat down to frame the note. For
ten minutes not a word was spoken. Each
boy at his own place was poring over a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lines he had written and then scratched, and
then written again.</p>

<p>The silence was broken at last by Frank's
voice exclaiming, "Well, who's through?"
No reply. "I say fellows, I can't get started."</p>

<p>"Ditto," echoed Dick.</p>

<p>"Me too!" chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>Each boy had about ten pages partly
written and scratched or torn. They had
never before realized the arduous task of a
diplomat. For this had to be a real diplomatic
note. A lot was at stake, and a single
word might spoil everything. At least so
they fancied.</p>

<p>"Let's do it at home, and get down here
early tomorrow night and settle it," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"Agreed," exclaimed Frank and Ned together.
And so hearty was their approval
that they left without even putting the
stopper on the ink bottle, let alone picking
up the scribbled and torn papers.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<h3>The New Quest</h3>


<p>The diplomats had hardly gone ten minutes
when Father Boone came into the Club
to get something he had forgotten in his
indignant exit. On his way down from the
office he passed through the library, and of
course noticed the disordered papers on the
table. The sheets were scribbled on and
scratched and some were crumpled and
torn. He paused to put things a bit in order,
and his eye caught his own name on one of
the papers. It began, "Dear Father Boone,"
and the same salutation headed several more
of the sheets. "Oho, what's this?" he exclaimed.
As the note was addressed to him,
and lying there on the open table, he read:</p>

<p>"Dear Father Boone, I want to tell you in
writing what I could not say to you in person.
I tried to but somehow I could not."</p>

<p>This is as far as it went. On the next page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he found the following: "If I could only let
you know that what hurts us most is that"
and there it stopped. Another page had this,
"I am sure there is something besides what
we know, because we have done nothing that
should so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." and there it ended.</p>

<p>He recognized Dick's handwriting on another
sheet which read as follows: "Dear
Father Boone, the boys realize that you must
have a good reason for your dis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.".
That was the abrupt ending. "We know
from experience that you never pun .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."
No more. Evidently Dick had got stuck fast.</p>

<p>The next pile of paper seemed to have little
or nothing on the sheets. The first page the
priest took up had "Ned" written all
over it. For variety there was here and
there "Ned Mullen." Evidently Ned was
hard pressed for a start when he filled that
sheet. On the next page there was a little
more variety, but not much more literature.
Here and there over the page were scrawled
the names of Ned&mdash;Ned Mullen&mdash;Hank&mdash;Dick&mdash;Father
Boone&mdash;Bull&mdash;and a drawing
of a dog. Poor Ned must have been hunting
hard for a good introduction.</p>

<p>Father Boone sat down near the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
His thoughts had taken a new turn. These
lads, he recalled, were on the committee.
Evidently they wanted to set something before
him, and were very much in earnest
about it. Such insistence indicated a serious
state of affairs. He should have heard them
out instead of withdrawing in indignation.
Still, he had done that only to impress them
with the seriousness of their conduct.</p>

<p>When they saw his indignation, why did
they not expostulate? But no, they said not
a word. He would have been glad to hear
their side, but at his first harsh words, they
simply stood there. Yet this attempt at
reaching him by note was a good sign. But
why did they not give some evidence of regret?
Their manner was not at all that of
boys who felt they had seriously offended.
And Frank, why <i>had he</i> not come like a man
to talk it over? "I had thought," he reflected,
"that Frank Mulvy had more consideration
and more heart."</p>

<p>His eye fell just then on a half-torn sheet
of paper on the floor. He picked it up from
under the chair and found on it these lines:</p>

<p>"Dear Father: We are all terribly cut up
and Frank most of all. We don't mind what's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
done nor what may happen to us, but we feel
awfully sorry for.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>That was all. That scrawl of Ned's fairly
upset the priest. It was so candid, so genuine,
so earnest. And it was not intended for
anyone's eyes. It was an unsuccessful attempt
to utter what was in the heart. Under
the stress of the situation it was the most
natural thing for the boys to leave the table
littered with scraps to be swept up by the
janitor next morning. His own coming in
was an accident.</p>

<p>He got some relief in considering that these
boys had stayed after the others, and filled
eight or ten pages in an effort to explain. It
meant that they were all right. He had
known it all along! He had had to do violence
to himself to believe that they would be
guilty of anything inconsiderate. He knew
how they felt towards him. These notes
were a proof. Boys who were not grateful
and considerate would not go to such pains
to rectify matters. And here he had
been for three days, firmly set against them.
Perhaps it was their very regard for him that
had kept back the explanations. He felt
happy in thinking so, for his boys meant a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
great deal to him. Tomorrow he would waive
all formalities and precedents and settle things.
He would hit the nail right on the head, state
his feelings and his amazement at what had
occurred and take whatever explanation they
gave. These notes showed him that at heart
the boys were the right kind. And that was
the main thing.</p>

<p>He had got so far, when back again came
the scene that had met his eyes when he
entered the Club rooms with the janitor.
Broken chairs, pictures down, ink on the floor,
overturned tables.</p>

<p>"No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." thought he, "that is too much;
for such vandalism there should have been
an explanation or an apology. And I can't
forget that Frank, no matter what his share
or his feelings, should have been true enough
to his duties to come and tell me. It's not the
damage; it's the principle of the thing. What
is the use of giving my time to the boys unless
I can hold them up to certain standards?
This is a social club under a priest's direction,
and it should stand for what is best in the
formation of character.</p>

<p>"Too much harm is done young fellows by
giving in to sentiment. They may resent my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
attitude now, but they will thank me for it
later. If I take a firm stand, it will be a lesson
to them for life. They will realize that the
right way is the best way. They must be
shown that although honor is not necessarily
sanctity, it is, nevertheless, a very close
attendant on it. Some boys think that if they
don't break one of the Commandments, they
are all right. They fail to see that the Commandments,
although they must be absolutely
kept, are only the big mile posts on the way of
life. A boy may easily lose his way unless he
cultivates the home virtues and the social
virtues.</p>

<p>"That's what this club is for, to make the
boys better sons and brothers and later on,
better citizens. Anything that is mean must
be shunned. A mean act, a mean fellow, must
not be tolerated. If a boy is mean or indecent,
and he can't be set right, he must go. It may
hurt him and his prospects, but that is better
than to hurt a crowd and their prospects.
A disgraceful affair has happened in the Club,
followed by dishonorable conduct. I'll see it
through." And, hitting the table with his
fist, he exclaimed, "I'll see it through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Frank had got home, and as he
would not have much time tomorrow, he
decided on writing his note to Father Boone
before going to bed. The rest of the family
were out, except his mother. He sat down at
his study desk and took up his task. He did
not know how to begin. If he could only get a
start, the matter would be easy. But that start
would not come. Finally he buried his head in
his hands, half thinking, half discouraged.</p>

<p>"Why," he thought, "should I do any writing
at all? I've been 'on the square.' I have
no apology to make. It seems that the harder
a fellow tries to be square, the harder he gets
hit. There's 'Bull,' the cause of all this row.
He's a regular thug. Yet he gets off easy. No
worry, no hurt feelings, no penalty. And here
I am, fretting and stewing, and I haven't done
a thing I can put my hand on. Father Boone's
treated me like a dog. I don't deserve that
from him. He's done a lot for me, of course,
but that doesn't give him the right to jump on
me." Springing up, he brought his fist down
on the table with a bang, and said aloud, "I'll
not stand for it&mdash;from Father Boone or anybody
else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked up in defiance only to see his
mother standing before him. Good mother
that she was, she took in the situation at once.
She did not say anything, but sat down alongside
him, and took his hand in her own. When
he had calmed down a bit, she said, "Won't
you let mother help you, dear? You know we
always make a good team."</p>

<p>Frank did not reply. He turned his face
away. He was deeply agitated. His mother
knew his tenderness and his strong will. She
knew there was a tempest raging in his soul,
and her heart ached for him. She put her arm
about him and pressed him a little closer.</p>

<p>Presently he gasped in choked and vehement
words: "I have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. always .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tried
to do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my best .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the result." Again his mother felt the convulsive
trembling through his body. But
under her tactful sympathy this paroxysm
soon passed off and with considerable calm
he gave her the outlines of his trouble.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvy not only knew her boy, but she
knew Father Boone as well. Her heart told
her there was a misunderstanding, and a big
one at that.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear," she began, "you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
suffered a lot but you have not done anything
you should be sorry for."</p>

<p>Here Frank interrupted her with a kiss.</p>

<p>"But I am sure," she continued, "that
Father Boone has suffered a lot too; maybe
more than you. I know how much he thinks
of you, and if he has taken this stand you can
be sure he has a strong reason for it and that
it has caused him pain. We don't know his
reason but we do know that he is good and
just and very kind, and that he never would
be so indignant without cause. My boy, there
is a third factor somewhere in this matter,
and both you and Father Boone are suffering
for it."</p>

<p>"That's what Dick and Ned said, mother,"
replied Frank, "but for the life of me I can't
figure it out."</p>

<p>"It may be," she answered, "he takes the
fight so seriously because you're an officer of
the Club&mdash;and the highest one."</p>

<p>"But, mother, he doesn't know yet who was
in the fight. No one has told him, and he
never pumps the fellows. All he knows is
that there was a fight, and I don't know how
he got that. Maybe someone heard the racket
and told him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps that is just it, and whoever told
him may have exaggerated the affair, and
Father Boone feels hurt that such a serious
matter did not reach him by the right way.
You see, dear, Father Boone is very honorable
himself, and he expects his boys to be very
careful of honor. That might be the explanation,
although I still believe there is something
more to it."</p>

<p>After a pause, Mrs. Mulvy continued, "And
then, Father Boone might feel hurt at what
I have referred to, but he would never punish
the whole Club for a thing like that. It's all a
mystery, I must admit, no matter which way
I turn. I have been thinking considerably over
it since the first night you spoke to me, and I
cannot make head or tail of it. Except this,
that I am certain there is something you and
I do not see about it."</p>

<p>"I guess you are right, mother. But what
do you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>"That is just it," she replied, "I don't know
what to do. If he were not a priest, I would
go to him for an explanation right away, but
I know that he knows his business and is fair.
So I guess it is better to leave it in his hands."</p>

<p>"O mother, I am so glad you said that. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was afraid you'd go down to see him, and then
I'd get 'kidded' by the fellows. They would
say that I had to get my mother to fight my
battles. I was going to make you promise that
you would keep out of this thing, but now I
don't have to. You are the good little mother."</p>

<p>"But," she interrupted, "I am going to ask
you for a promise. No matter what happens,
and no matter what the other boys do, you
won't ever do anything or say anything disrespectful
to Father Boone, or about him?"</p>

<p>"O, that's easy, mother. I had made up my
mind that that was one thing I couldn't do&mdash;anything
that would reflect on him."</p>

<p>She kissed him proudly, and a big load was
lifted from his heart. Nothing would matter
now. His mother was with him. He could
stand anything with her back of him. He
withdrew to his bedroom and knelt down
before his little altar to offer the sufferings of
the day as a sacrifice to the Sacred Heart of
Jesus. "Sweet Jesus, I have suffered much
today. Take my sufferings as penance for my
sins and as thanksgiving for bestowing on me
such a good mother, and give me strength to
bear everything rather than offend Thee."
He arose light-hearted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>A few moments later his mother heard him
humming a hymn to the Blessed Virgin:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mother dear, O pray for me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When far from heaven and thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wander in a fragile bark</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O'er life's tempestuous sea."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"He is all right now," reflected Mrs. Mulvy
as she went to her room smiling.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(III)</div>

<p>After his soliloquy, Father Boone went to
the rectory in a firm frame of mind. When he
got there, he found Mrs. Daly waiting for him.
She came, she said, to ask his advice about
Willie and his father. The father came home
drunk nearly every night, and in such a condition,
that Willie could not only defend himself,
but could also injure his father. Tonight,
she went on to relate, they had an awful time.
She had to interfere to prevent serious harm
to one or both.</p>

<p>"Only for Willie being so good to his mother
I would not dare rush in between them. But
I know that no matter what happens, he
would never hurt me. So tonight I threw
myself right between them, and separated
them. Father, I am getting tired of this life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
It's not Christian. I was brought up well, and
though you mightn't think it, I know the
difference. So I came to see you to ask your
advice. Should I put him away again? It did
no good last time. He came out every bit as
bad as before, and worse. Now what am I
to do?"</p>

<p>The priest listened sympathetically, and
when she paused, he asked, "Is he home now?"</p>

<p>"He is, your Reverence."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go over and see him."</p>

<p>He showed her to the door, told her to say
nothing to her husband, and promised he
would be over inside an hour. Some thirty or
forty minutes later he was poking his way up
the dingy and dirty stairs to the Daly flat.
Bill was out. No doubt the home had few
attractions for him. Mr. Daly had been pretty
badly shaken up by the encounter with his
son, and sat fairly sobered on the edge of the
bed. The priest entered, made a sign to Mrs.
Daly to withdraw, and crossing the room,
sat down alongside Daly.</p>

<p>"Well, Michael," he began, "I have come
over to see you because I know you need a
friend. You know I married you, Michael,
and baptized Willie. You were a fine man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
then, none better, and you and the Missus
were very proud of the baby. Well, Michael,
you have got clean off the track&mdash;and it does
not pay, does it, Michael? You had your nice
little home and a tender wife, and a boy you
were proud of. And all that is gone now,
Michael. And pretty soon you'll be gone, too.
It does not pay, does it? For the bit of
pleasure you get from the liquor, see the price
you have paid. It was not the ten cents nor
the quarter you put over the bar, but it is this
ruined home, Michael Daly. It is a slave and
a sloven you have made of your wife, and it is
driving the boy to the police, you are doing.
Now, in God's Name, Michael, stop it. It is
not too late. I will help you, and the wife will
help you and Willie will help you. I know you
had a fight with him just now, but that is past.
It was the liquor did it. Tell me, Michael,
you will be a man and cut the stuff out?"</p>

<p>Tears were forming in the man's eyes as the
priest looked at his upturned face.</p>

<p>"I'm a beast and no man," he moaned, "I'm
down and out. I'm a curse to myself and my
own. I'm not worth your bothering about me.
Let me alone. Let Mike Daly go his way, he's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
done for. The devil of whisky has got him
and he'll get him for good some day."</p>

<p>"Mike Daly," said the priest firmly, "you
are down, God knows, but you are not out.
And you are not going to be."</p>

<p>"That's all very well. It's that easy to say,
but you don't know the grip that this devil
has on me. I've tried and tried and tried,
only to fall back again into the gutter. I tell
you it's all up with me."</p>

<p>"If it is up with you, it is because you want
it to be so," said the priest. "But I tell you,
Mike Daly, you are on the brink of hell and
the only thing that keeps you from falling
into it, is the slender barrier of life. Do you
realize that you may be called out of life to
judgment any moment without warning? My
God! man, where is your faith? If you break
the law of the government, you know what
would happen! And is not God's law more
sacred? Do you suppose you can trifle with
the Almighty? Because God does not punish
you on the spot, do you think you can ignore
Him?"</p>

<p>By this time Daly was quite himself. He
had never had such a talking to. The words
went right into his soul. He knew about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
punishment for a man if he breaks the law of
the country. And it surely was true that God's
law is more serious. That hit him hard. The
priest saw that the man was wavering, and he
continued:</p>

<p>"Now, Michael, I'll tell you what we will
do. But first I shall ask you an honest question,
man to man. Do you want to get away
from the vile stuff?"</p>

<p>"I do," fairly roared Daly.</p>

<p>"Good," said the priest, "that's half the
battle. Now, I want you to know that I am
the best friend you've got on earth outside
your own family. I shall ask you to do nothing
but what is for your own good. Will you trust
me?"</p>

<p>"I will, so help me God!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"And it is God who is going to help you,"
said the priest. "You are going to be a man
again, Mike Daly. I guarantee that. <i>Do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. understand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that?</i>" said the priest
slowly and firmly.</p>

<p>"I do," answered the now aroused and
interested man.</p>

<p>"Then listen: You are just a 'bum' now&mdash;a
low down, bar-room 'bum.' Nobody wants
you around. You can't get a job anywhere. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
am going to get you a good job. You won't
go back on the priest if he gives his word
for you?"</p>

<p>"So help me! No," cried Mike.</p>

<p>"Now, another thing," said the priest.
"When you went to church every Sunday, and
received Holy Communion once a month, you
were a good God-fearing man. That's where
we begin. You make a friend of God first of
all. It's hard enough to go through life right
with God and with His help, but it is impossible
without it. It's years since you have
been to church, and the Sacraments, and you
know these have been the most unhappy years
of your life."</p>

<p>Just then Bill entered. He was surprised to
see the priest talking to his father. Immediately
he supposed that he had come to complain
about the breakage and mischief at the
Club. But he was set right almost immediately.</p>

<p>"William," said the priest, kindly and
proudly, "come over here and shake hands
with your father."</p>

<p>The boy hesitated.</p>

<p>Again the priest spoke: "William, come
and take the hand of a man that is never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
going to touch liquor in his life again. Your
father is a new man."</p>

<p>"O father, father!" cried Bill, as he rushed
across the room.</p>

<p>No words. Tears of the father and son as
the two embraced.</p>

<p>The priest, meanwhile, had gone into the
kitchen to tell the good news to Mrs. Daly.
She rushed in to find the father and son weeping
over each other.</p>

<p>"O Michael, Michael," she shouted, "I
knew the Blessed Mother would never let you
go to the end as you were!" And she fairly
fell on them both.</p>

<p>The priest withdrew, and would have left
altogether, but that he had not finished his
work. After a while, he came into the room
and said, "All three of you kneel down." They
got on their knees. "May God Almighty, the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, bless you."</p>

<p>"Amen" responded the three.</p>

<p>"And may the Blessed Mother help and
protect you."</p>

<p>"Amen" again came the response.</p>

<p>They arose. It was a transfiguration.
Determination and pride on Daly's face, love
on Mrs. Daly's, and gladness on the boy's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Michael, I want you to go to confession
next Saturday night and receive Holy
Communion on Sunday," said the priest.
"You do your part, and God will do His. You
have given Him no opportunity to help you
these past years. You have kept away from
Him, your best Friend and Helper."</p>

<p>"Never again," said Daly, firmly.</p>

<p>"Straighten up now," said the priest, "and
come to see me Monday morning. I'll have a
job for you by that time. Here's a few dollars
to get some clothes. You can pay me back
when you have it to spare. Good-bye."</p>

<p>For sometime after the priest went away,
they spoke not a word. They could not, for
something seemed to lodge in their throats.
When Mrs. Daly found that she could use her
voice, she went to a little box on the bureau,
kept carefully in the midst of all the confusion,
and taking out her rosary of the
Blessed Virgin, she went over to her husband
and son and said, "And now let us thank her."
They knelt down, said the beads and finished
with the prayer:</p>

<p>"Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our
life, our sweetness and our hope; to thee do we
cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping
in this valley of tears. Turn then, most
gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward
us, and after this our exile, show unto us the
blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement,
O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary."</p>

<p>There is joy even in heaven over a sinner
that doth penance.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IV)</div>

<p>The effects of Father Boone's visit at the
Daly home began to show at once; the father,
mother and son were transformed. Michael
Daly spoke of it first. "I've not had a day's
luck since I've been away from the Church,
and I'm going to get back."</p>

<p>"O Blessed Mother, do you hear him?"
exclaimed Mrs. Daly. "Holy Mary, pray for
us sinners now."</p>

<p>"I've had my last drink, so help me!" continued
Daly. "I've said it often before, and
gone back to the dirty stuff. But something
new has come into my life. Father Boone's
words burned right into my soul. And every
word he said was true, so help me!"</p>

<p>All the while, Bill was wondering. Could
it be real? It all seemed so new to him. For
eight years he had heard nothing but blasphemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and abuse from his father, and here he
was now, talking and acting like a man. Was
it a reality? He could hardly believe his
senses. But there was his father arm and arm
with his mother. That certainly was real.
It was years since he had seen anything like
that before. The sight, so unusual, began to
overpower him. He ran to his father and
cried out, "O Dad, Dad, Dad!"</p>

<p>For a moment he could say no more.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Willie boy," said his father.
"Dad's all right, and he's going to stay so."</p>

<p>It is true that Willie had become more or
less a "tough." His environment had hardened
him. He had had to fight his way along. But
one thing always stood by him, his affection
for his mother. Something else also was a big
factor in keeping him from going altogether
bad. He never failed to say his morning and
evening prayers. His early training under the
good Sisters at the parochial school served as
an anchor to hold him to his religion. The
prayers he had learned there, the pious
mottoes on the walls, the example of the Sisters,
all had made a strong impression on his
young mind although his conduct often failed
to show it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>He remembered also some of the incidents
they had related. One in particular never left
his mind. In consequence of it, he had resolved
never to say an immodest word or do an
unclean deed. No boy ever heard an impure
word from Bill, no matter how rough he might
be. He would fight, yes. He would swagger
and bluster. But he could never forget the
promise he had made one day in church,
before the altar of the Blessed Virgin, that he
would never say anything to make her blush.
And so far he never had, although he had
often been with companions whose conversation
and conduct would bring the crimson to
any decent face.</p>

<p>He had from his faith a realization of the
presence of God in the world. He remembered
a large frame in the class room wherein was
the picture of a triangle. In the center was
an Eye. It seemed to be looking right at him,
no matter where he was, and under it was
written, "The All-Seeing Eye of God." The
Sister one day had said to the boys that they
should always live in such a way that they
should be glad God was looking at them.
That made a great impression on him. Of
course, he often forgot the Eye. But on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
occasion, when he was strongly tempted to
steal, and the two boys with him did steal, he
saw that Eye, and remained honest. The day
after, the two fellows were caught and sent to
the reformatory for a year. The Eye of God
meant even more to him after that.</p>

<p>On another occasion, he could have received
an afternoon off by lying, as did
several of his companions. But the Eye was
looking at him, and he would not tell the lie.
It is true, there was many a slip, for poor
Bill was only human and a boy. And after
all, religion does not suppose we are all
saints. Its purpose is to make us such. It
has hard work on some material. But no
substance is too hard for it, if only it has
half a chance. Bill, although a 'bad nut' as
many called him, was not so bad as he might
have been. If it were not for his religion,
poorly as he practised it, he would have gone
to the bad utterly. So Bill now stood facing
a new thing in his life. His father was turning
in a new direction. Would he keep on in it,
or fall back, as so often before?</p>

<p>There was something different about this
event, Bill felt. He had never seen that
peculiar and stern look in his father's eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
before. And he remembered that the Sisters
had often told them how God would help
us do things that we could not do ourselves
if we truly turned to Him. It did seem as
though his father had truly turned to God.
Bill also remembered how every day the
Sister had had the whole class say one
"Hail Mary" for those who were in temptation.</p>

<p>He went to his bedroom, closed the door,
took out an old prayer book and, opening it
to a picture of the Mother of God, he prayed
earnestly, finishing with "Holy Mary, Mother
of God, pray for us sinners <i>now</i> and at the
hour of our death, Amen." Then he added,
"Blessed Mother of God, strengthen my poor
father and make him good and sober."</p>

<p>Bill reflected that Father Boone had once
told the boys that if they wanted anything
of God or of the Saints, they should add
sacrifices to their petitions. "Blessed Mother,
in thy honor and for my father's reform, I will
leave off smoking until I am twenty-one."
He arose renewed and light-hearted.</p>

<p>All next day he revolved in his mind the
scurvy trick he had done at the Club. He
knew the pride Father Boone took in having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
things nice there. In reality it was the priest
who had suffered by his wreckage, he reflected,
not the boys. Sure, they had suffered, too.
The McCormack treat had been called off.
That was a mean trick. He had "queered"
the crowd to get square on one or two. And
after all, what had he to square? Mulvy had
fought him straight.</p>

<p>The more he thought on it, the more Bill
felt ashamed of himself. By night he had
fully made up his mind to go over to the
Club, make a clean breast of it all, and take
the consequences. "And I'll offer that up
too," said he, "for Dad."</p>


<div class='center'><br />(V)</div>

<p>At the Club the next evening, all the fellows
were talking matters over. Father
Boone was upstairs in his office. He had said
to himself a dozen times, "I must keep a
hold on that boy Daly. He is a diamond in
the rough. I'd like to know how many of
these fellows downstairs would be much
better if they went through what he has
experienced. I must see to it that he gets a
fair show. The fellows are down on him.
Maybe they have had cause, but they've got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to help me give the fellow his chance. Another
reason for getting at the heart of this affair
without any more delay&mdash;a boy's soul and
his welfare are at stake."</p>

<p>The boys below were pretty glum. Things
were not the same. A shadow was over the
place. When Frank came in, however, his
face was so placid that at first they thought
he had adjusted matters.</p>

<p>"Well, old man, what's the good news?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet, fellows, but I guess it'll
come out all right."</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and in walked
Daly. For a few seconds no one said a word.
They just looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>Daly's walk to the Club had been hard
going. The nearer he got to it, the more he
hesitated. What would Father Boone say?
Facing the boys was one thing&mdash;he could
fight down his mean deed, but how about
Father Boone and his interest in his father&mdash;and
the job he was going to get him? Would
this revelation knock that all to pieces?
How could Father Boone trust a man whose
boy broke into a house and smashed things
up?</p>

<p>All this stood out boldly before Bill. So did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the Eye of God. "He sees, and I'll go ahead
and trust in Him," he concluded. And so he
went up the steps leading to the Club door,
passed timidly along the hallway and opened
the door, where the boys were discussing
the committee affair. As he stood in the
doorway, silence held the crowd. After a
moment, indignation broke loose. It showed
itself first in looks of contempt, then in moving
away from him.</p>

<p>"That's all right fellows, I'm the goat, and
I deserve to be."</p>

<p>They thought he was sarcastic. But the
words came from his very soul.</p>

<p>Mistaking him, they flung back cutting
remarks: "You're a Billy Goat, all right,"
came from one quarter.</p>

<p>"So you've changed from a Bull to a Goat"
greeted him from another side.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Bill felt like rushing in
and striking right and left. But he checked
himself. It was a violent effort and showed
on his countenance.</p>

<p>"It's a nice fix you've got us in," shouted
Tommy Hefnan.</p>

<p>Of course that meant to Bill that they
knew the whole story of the damaged room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
"Fellows," he exclaimed, "I did a mean trick
and I'm willing to take my medicine." The
boys saw in this only a reference to the fight.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Bill," exclaimed Frank.
"It was my fault as much as yours. We
shook hands on it when it was over, and
as far as I'm concerned, it's ended." Then
turning to the crowd he said, "I say, fellows,
let's call it square," to which they more or
less willingly agreed.</p>

<p>Bill now felt that he was small compared
with his late opponent. He saw Frank do by
a word what he himself could not do by
words or blows. He waited until he got the
opportunity, and then gave Frank a signal
that he had something to say. Frank stepped
aside.</p>

<p>"I want to make myself right with the
'bunch'," Bill told him. "I came over for that.
But if I start to speak, they'll 'ride' me. You
can help me. I got to say, Mulvy, that you're
a far better fellow than I am, in every way. I
was a skunk to bring on that fight. And I was
worse than a skunk in doing what I did afterwards.
But I'll be hanged if I'm going to
stay one. I'll take all that's coming to me
and square myself. You know what I mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused for a reply, but Frank's ideas
were in too much confusion to permit a ready
answer. This was strong language to apply
to a mere fight. It suggested that there was
truth in the surmise of Ned Mullen, that
there was more than the fight to account for
the unusual stand taken by Father Boone in
the affair.</p>

<p>Bill cleared his throat nervously, to continue,
when the clang of fire bells sounded,
and the rushing of the fire engines and trucks
along the street brought the boys in a stampede
to the door and the street windows.
Frank and Bill were carried along with the
others.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VI)</div>

<p>Ordinarily, the passing of a fire engine
engaged the crowd's attention but a few
moments. The dashing engine and hose-cart
always made a good spectacle. But now as
the Club boys looked along the street, they
saw not only smoke but flames. And they
heard screams. All the fellows rushed out
and followed the engine to the place where
the police were roping off the fire line. The
hook-and-ladder came along at a tearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pace. The firemen jumped from the truck,
hoisted up the long, frail-looking ladder, and
threw it against the cornice of the roof.</p>

<p>The shock somehow unhitched a connection
at the last extension. The ladder hung
suspended by only a light piece of the frame.
In the window right under the ladder was
a woman, and a child of four or five years.
The firemen felt that if they brought the
ladder back to an upright position, the last
extension would break and they would not
be able to reach the window. On the other
hand, the ladder, as it stood, could not sustain
a man's weight. A minute seemed an hour.</p>

<p>One of the firemen started to take the
chance and run up. His foreman pulled him
back. "It's sure death, Jim," he shouted.
"That ladder won't hold you. You'd drop
before you could reach them."</p>

<p>The foreman was right. The men were
willing enough but there was no chance of
reaching the top, or halfway to it.</p>

<p>Now Father Boone came running up. On
learning that lives were in danger he had
hastened to the Church, gotten the holy oils,
and hurried over to be of service, if occasion
required.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The cries of the woman and child were
piercing and heart-rending. The life nets
were spread and the men shouted to them to
jump. But they were paralyzed with fear.
One of the firemen was heard to exclaim,
"I wish I weighed a hundred pounds less, I'd
risk that ladder."</p>

<p>Bill Daly, in the forefront of the crowd,
heard him. Two lives at stake! He weighed
a hundred pounds less than that man. And,
as he hesitated, a great fear clutching at his
heart, his mind was filled with a medley of
thoughts, in which mingled the idea of sacrifice
for his father's reform, the Eye of God,
his own worthlessness, his confession not yet
made, and the glory of heroic deeds. Again
a terrible, piercing cry from above. Without
a second's waiting, without warning, before
the firemen knew it, he had rushed under the
rope, over to the truck, and like a cat, was
on his way up the ladder.</p>

<p>Bill had often seen the firemen couple the
ladders in the station near his home. He
knew if he got there in time he could put the
detached parts together. Up he went, hands
and feet, as fast as he could move. The ladder
swayed. The men yelled to him to come back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
He evidently heard nothing and saw nothing
but that dangling extension, which was all
that separated him from death. Without
slowing up a bit, he reached the uncoupled
extension, fastened it, and made the ladder
secure. Hardly had it fallen into place, when
several, firemen were on their way up. The
thing was done.</p>

<p>The excitement of it over, Bill suddenly
realized that he was high up in the air. The
climbing of the firemen made the ladder
sway. Before anyone realized what was
happening, Bill lost his balance, tottered, fell
over completely, and went headlong down.
The men below holding the life net under the
window, saw him totter and changed their
position as fast as possible in order to get
under him. But he fell so suddenly that they
hardly had time to shift. They had scarcely
got into position, when down he came into
the net, before it had tightened up. The fall
was considerably broken, but he landed hard
enough to make the thud distinctly heard.
And there he lay in a heap, limp. He was
unconscious. They lifted him out, carried
him over to the Club room, and sent for a
doctor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Father Boone, who had been
the first to reach him, hastily anointed him
and gave him conditional absolution. He
was about to return to the fire to be on hand
in case others were injured, but one of the
firemen came in just then and said that the
woman and child were rescued, and that the
fire was under control.</p>

<p>So the priest sat beside Bill, holding his
hand, and patting his forehead. Instead of a
doctor, an ambulance arrived. Bill was carried
on a stretcher into the wagon, and with
a warning clang, it was off for the hospital.
The doctor was on one side of him, the priest
on the other. Neither spoke. Both kept
their eyes on the patient. The doctor held
his pulse, and moved his eyelids to observe
the extent of the danger. A hasty examination
at the hospital emergency room showed
a badly injured arm and side, and a bruised,
but not fractured, skull.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VII)</div>

<p>Having been assured that the case was not
fatal, Father Boone boarded a trolley and
soon found himself near the Daly tenement.
He was used to errands like this. And yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
this had something different about it. Often
had he carried sad news to wives and mothers
and fathers. But there was an element of
tragedy in this case. Only the day before,
he had left the Dalys starting out on a new
way, father, mother and son. And now the
link that bound father and mother, if not
broken, was very close to it. Would the
news start Mike Daly drinking? Would it
harden him, or would he see in it the hand
of God?</p>

<p>With these thoughts in his mind, he rapped
gently at the door. Mrs. Daly met him all
radiant. A wonderful change had occurred.
The room was neat and clean, she herself was
as tidy as a pin and in walked Daly himself,
greatly improved by a clean shave and a clean
collar. "I want to see both of you together,"
he said. "I have a bit of good news for you."</p>

<p>They walked into the front room. It was
really decent now. The home as well as the
occupants had undergone a change.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Daly," began the priest,
"I want to congratulate you. You have a
boy to be proud of. You have someone to
live for. Willie is a hero. He has just saved
two lives at a fire."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>At the word fire, and at not seeing their
boy along with the priest, a certain apprehension
seized them both. Neither spoke for a
moment, and then Daly said, "And where is
the boy?"</p>

<p>"He is all right," answered the priest.
"He got a few scratches and bruises, but it is
nothing much. He is a real hero, and all the
boys are talking about him. I just thought
I'd be the first to bring you the news."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Father dear," exclaimed
Mrs. Daly.</p>

<p>The priest now felt that the worst part of
his task was over. In a reassuring tone he
narrated all that had happened. He made
up his mind to tell everything just as it was,
because he felt it was better for them to get
it from him and with him near, than in any
other way.</p>

<p>When he got to the fall from the ladder, the
mother screamed and fell back in her chair.
The priest was not unprepared for this. He
dashed cold water into her face, and soon she
came to, moaning and uttering pious ejaculations
for her son. By the time the priest
was ready to leave, both father and mother
were composed and resigned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should thank God, both of you,"
said Father Boone to them, "that He has left
you your boy. It is a lesson to all of us to
live in such a way as to be always ready to
meet God whenever He calls us out of life.
Now you, Michael, no matter what happens,
don't you ever think that the liquor will
drown your sorrow. I'd rather see Willie a
corpse than to see you drunk again."</p>

<p>"And so would I myself, so help me!"
exclaimed Michael.</p>

<p>The priest nodded, satisfied that now
Michael was out of the pit. He gave them
the hospital address, and advised them not
to go before the next day, unless they received
a message. No news, he assured them, was
good news.</p>

<p>No news might be good news, but not for a
mother. Hardly had the door closed when
Mrs. Daly put on her things and made ready
to start for the hospital.</p>

<p>The priest had a good deal to think about.
There was a possibility that Willie's condition
was serious on account of internal
injuries. What a blow it would be to the
parents if he should die! When he reached
home, the first thing he did was to telephone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the hospital and inquire about the boy.
He was informed that the patient was resting
quietly. "That is good," he said to himself,
"for I should not be at all surprised if Mrs.
Daly ran down to see the lad tonight."
With that he went over to the Club, wrote a
few letters, and then returned to the rectory
for the night.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VIII)</div>

<p>The boys were late leaving the Club after
the excitement of the fire. They spoke in
suppressed tones. Admiration and regret prevailed&mdash;admiration
for Bill's daring deed&mdash;regret
for their conduct to him just before.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Tommy, "I'm sorry I sailed
into him the way I did."</p>

<p>"And who would have thought he was
such a daring chap!" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"It only shows," added Ned, "that you
never can tell what's in a fellow."</p>

<p>"We called him the 'Bull'," said Frank,
"and in one way we were right, for that was
the bulliest thing I ever saw. My hat is off
to Bill Daly."</p>

<p>After a while, they turned to speculating
on his condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope it's nothing serious," remarked
Dick.</p>

<p>"Suppose we wait until Father Boone
comes back," added Tommy. "He'll tell us
exactly what's the matter."</p>

<p>After it had got to be late, Frank observed,
"I'll bet he's waiting for Bill to regain consciousness,
and there's no telling when he'll
be back. Let's wait a quarter of an hour
more, and then if he's not here, we'd better
go."</p>

<p>They all assented to this and when the
time was up, they started to leave. Frank,
however, signalled to Dick and Ned and
Tommy, and they loitered about until the
rest had gone.</p>

<p>"Fellows," began Frank, "I had a letter
all written to Father Boone about the scrape
we're in, but I tore it up, I'm surer than ever
that something worse has happened than that
fight. I don't even believe that Father Boone
knows who was in it. But that scrap was the
basis of something else, something really
serious. Bill Daly knows what it was, believe
me. He came here tonight to straighten things
out. Did you see how he came in, and how
he stood the 'gaff'? Would he have taken all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that from kids like you unless he had something
big troubling him? And that's not all.
He got me aside and began to talk confidentially,
hinting at something dark, you
know. He was just getting ready to accuse
himself when the fire engine came along, and
you know the rest."</p>

<p>The three others nodded in agreement with
Frank and awaited further light on the
matter.</p>

<p>"That's all," he continued, "except that I
never saw such an exalted look on any boy's
face as when he leaped for that ladder. It
just seemed to say 'I know you've got me
down bad, boys, but here goes to show you
that there is some good left in Bill Daly.'"</p>

<p>In point of fact, Bill had never given the
boys a thought when he made his plunge for
the ladder. But the look of exaltation, as
Frank called it, was there nevertheless. Its
source was higher than Frank gave him
credit for.</p>

<p>"Now I maintain," asserted Frank, "that
the fellow was glad of the chance to set himself
right with the Club. And from what he
hinted at, I'm certain, too, that he did something
to 'queer' us with Father Boone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
something pretty bad, too, for I never before
knew Father Boone to take such measures
as he has in this affair."</p>

<p>"You're a regular Sherlock Holmes, old
man," observed Dick.</p>

<p>"Sherlock Holmes or not," said Frank,
"you'll find out before this thing is settled
that I'm right. A man like Father Boone
does not change his character over night.
Something has happened to make him take
this attitude, and I'd give my hat to know
what it is."</p>

<p>Frank's hat may not have been worth much,
but it seemed to be the limit of his disposable
property&mdash;to judge by the extreme earnestness
with which he risked it. At all events
the boys felt that Frank was keenly convinced
of his position, and as he was always
careful about his conclusions, they were
inclined to agree with him.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IX)</div>

<p>In this frame of mind the chums parted.
The others went directly home. Frank made
some excuse for loitering and as soon as they
were gone, took his way in the direction of
the hospital. It was fully ten o'clock, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the hospital was nearly a mile off. He had to
walk, but by a combination of brisk walking
and occasional sprints, he got to the place
in short time.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet about the immense
building. In the main vestibule Frank found
a matter-of-fact, middle-aged man standing
behind a desk, over which was a sign&mdash;"Bureau
of Information." Several people were
seated on a long bench nearby, waiting to be
conducted to friends or relatives who were
patients, or to get word of their condition.</p>

<p>Frank approached the desk timidly, and
said to the clerk, "May I ask, sir, how
William Daly is?"</p>

<p>At the words 'William Daly,' there was a
scream and a flutter from the bench, and in
a moment a woman stood before Frank and
put her arms about him, crying as she did so,
"Do you know my Willie? Are you one of
Father Boone's boys?" Without waiting for
an answer, she went on, with sobs and exclamations,
to give a fond mother's estimate
of the best boy in the world.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Daly told of her Willie's affection
for her, she broke down completely. The
clerk summoned a nurse. Mrs. Daly was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
taken into a side room, and under the firm
but kind management of the nurse, she soon
calmed down. Frank, although so tender-hearted,
was not an expert at giving sympathy.
Indeed, it was good that he was not,
for in Mrs. Daly's hysterical condition, sympathy
would have made her worse. The
excitement was hardly over when word came
from the office that William had regained consciousness,
and that he was out of danger.
The messenger also added that he was sleeping
quietly, and that it was not advisable to
disturb him now, but that his mother would
be welcome to see him in the morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Daly turned to Frank. "You are one
of Willie's friends?"</p>

<p>Frank reflected on the fight and the contemptuous
terms that Bill had used toward
him, but he also remembered their final talk,
and so replied without hesitation, "Yes,
Mrs. Daly."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was the good boy to his mother!
And it's a hard time of it he's had, with no
one knowing how much the poor boy went
through to help his mother. O Blessed
Mother of God, help him from your place in
heaven!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was affected by the emotion which
was again overcoming the fond mother, but he
said as calmly as he could, "Don't you think
we had better go home now, Mrs. Daly?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't go home and him up there,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"But you can't stay here all night,"
objected Frank. "Come home with me now.
That's what Bill would want if he had the
say."</p>

<p>"Is that what you call him&mdash;Bill?"</p>

<p>"O, for short you know, Mrs. Daly. Boys
always take short cuts."</p>

<p>"I never called him anything but Willie,"
she sighed and started to cry again.</p>

<p>"Won't you come home now?" Frank
asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"I've got no heart to go anywhere while
he is up there," she again declared.</p>

<p>Frank now realized that things were getting
serious. His own mother would be anxious
about him, and the hospital bench was not a
place for Mrs. Daly to spend the night. He
tried all his persuasive powers, to no effect.</p>

<p>While he was in this state of anxiety, he
heard a voice at the desk ask, "Is William
Daly doing nicely? Has he regained consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
yet?" Looking up, Frank, to his
great joy, saw Father Boone. At the same
instant, hearing a sob and looking in its
direction, the priest perceived Mrs. Daly and
Frank. He stepped over to where they were.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, my dear woman," he
exclaimed, "this is no place for you at this
hour. And you, Frank? I must say I am glad
to see you here, but we must all go home now.
Wait for me a minute. I'll just run upstairs
and see William." As a priest, he had access to
the wards at any hour of the day or night.
It occurred to him that the patient might be
conscious by that time, and he decided to
see him and hear his confession if possible.
He was conducted to Daly's bed, and saw
that he was sleeping soundly. He knew that
sleep was the best medicine; so he left the
patient, after giving him his blessing.</p>

<p>"He is sleeping like a baby, Mrs. Daly,"
was the way he saluted the mother, as he
drew near. Then, waiting for neither <i>yes</i> nor
<i>no</i>, he took it for granted that they were all
going home. Under his dominant and kindly
manner, Mrs. Daly was like a child. Father
Boone called a cab and gave the driver the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
order to take both Mrs. Daly and Frank to
their homes. He put a bill in Frank's hand
to pay the fares, and without waiting for
thanks or protestations, closed the taxi door,
and walked briskly homeward.</p>

<p>Father Boone felt, after the crowded events
and impressions of the day, that he needed
the walk back to the rectory to clear his head.
"I was right," he declared to himself, "Mulvy
is all gold. The consideration of that boy!
I've gone wrong somewhere! Frank's too
tender-hearted to cause me pain, deliberately,
and he is too brave to shirk <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'responsibilty'">responsibility</ins>&mdash;to
fail in the discharge of his duty. Deductions
do not avail against known characteristics.
A boy of Mulvy's character doesn't
do a cowardly thing. I know that&mdash;evidence
or no evidence. And yet&mdash;that plagued
mystery keeps staring me in the face! If
they had told me they'd had a free-for-all!
I can make allowances. I know boys. Here
it's nearly a week, and not one word in regard
to the affair. And they know I am all cut
up over it.</p>

<p>"What's up anyway? Why didn't I send
for Mulvy after the first day and demand a
report or explanation? Pride, I suppose;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hurt, at their lack of confidence in me. Well,
the only thing is to get down from my high
horse now. I've got to begin with myself.</p>

<p>"And yet," his thoughts swung around,
"I don't know as it is pride exactly. There's
the fitness of things&mdash;just indignation. Our
Lord himself had to show it to the Scribes
and Pharisees. I want those boys to know
they're not acting right. That's my real
motive." He sighed deeply. "Here I am
again between post and pillar. I don't know
what to do. I want to take the stand that
will be of true benefit to the boys, not merely
now but later."</p>

<p>So reflecting, he reached the rectory. A
few minutes later, the light in his room was
out and he had finished a busy and painful
day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frank saw Mrs. Daly home,
and in a little while he was dismissing the
chauffeur at his own door. Quickly he ran
up the steps of his apartment house and in a
moment had climbed the three flights of
stairs. Everybody was in bed but his mother.
Her first words were, "O my boy, what has
happened to you? I was alarmed at your
staying out so late."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank felt he should at least give some
account of himself at once. In the most
matter of fact way, he narrated the evening's
events. But his mother discerned his generous
heart beneath his words, and she was
proud of him&mdash;so brave and so tender. And
especially was she glad that Father Boone
had found Frank at the hospital with Mrs.
Daly. She knew how that would affect the
misunderstanding, and she was more than
satisfied with the turn of affairs when Frank
finished his recital by saying, "I tell you,
mother, Father Boone is a brick." Then, as
he feared that this did not convey a great
deal of meaning to her, he added, "He is
'some' man."</p>

<p>"And somebody is 'some' boy," echoed
his mother, kissing him good-night.</p>

<p>Frank went to his room, said his prayers
and jumped into bed. "I'll sleep until noon,"
he muttered, as he got under the covers. He
closed his eyes, but although he was dead
tired, he could not sleep. Indeed, it seemed
he was more wide awake than at midday.
The clock struck twelve, and still his mind
was all activity.</p>

<p>He saw himself chatting with Daly&mdash;heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the fire-clang&mdash;saw Bill run up the ladder&mdash;beheld
him waver, totter and fall&mdash;saw his
limp body in the net&mdash;heard the afflicted
mother speak of her Willie&mdash;her good boy
Willie, whom the boys called "Bull." And
then there was Father Boone, always in the
right place, and doing the proper thing, cool,
firm, kind, commanding. And this was the
man he was on the outs with. Was it more
likely that a boy like himself would be wrong
or Father Boone?</p>

<p>"I'm a boob," he accused himself. "I
should have gone to him at the start. Even
if he were cross&mdash;most likely he'd heard
there was a row, and I was in it. Then, of
course, he'd feel hurt that I hadn't shown
him more confidence. But great guns! I
did go up to make a clean breast of it, and got
'cold feet'. But that's not his fault. That's
how the whole blame thing began. Gosh, I
wish I had some of Bill Daly's sand!"</p>

<p>He had begun to feel a little drowsy. The
clock struck one and he was murmuring "a
little .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bill .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Daly's .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'sand' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Bill .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Daly's .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sand
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sand!" And off he fell into the land
of nod.</p>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<h3>Comrades</h3>


<p>It was full daylight when Bill Daly opened
his eyes the next morning. On all sides of him
were beds. Nurses and doctors were walking
noiselessly up and down the ward. He did
not know what to make of it. He had never
been in a hospital before, even as a visitor.
He had to make an effort to collect his
thoughts.</p>

<p>O yes! the fire. That shaky ladder. The
woman and the child at the window crying
for help. His quick ascent up the ladder.
The adjustment&mdash;a sudden sensation of dizziness&mdash;and
then! Yes, he must have fallen.</p>

<p>Just then he moved his arm a bit, and a
moan issued from his distorted mouth. He
knew now&mdash;who he was and what had happened.
He changed the position of his head
and a groan escaped him. He moved his body
ever so little, and pain shot all through it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"Oh, Oh, Oh," he groaned. After that, for a
moment, he lay as quiet as possible. "O,
I'm a girl, all right," he told himself. "What
am I groaning about? I'll bet Mulvy would
take his medicine. That's 'some' boy, Mulvy.
Never grunted once, and I hit him all over.
O for a little of his 'sand.'"</p>

<p>Just then he moved his arm again, and
another moan escaped him. A nurse, passing
by, heard him.</p>

<p>"That's all right, little man," she said,
"it's painful, but no broken bones; you'll be
on your feet soon." Bill shut his jaw tight.
His suffering recalled to his mind a story one
of the Sisters had told the class a few years
previously, of a little boy led into the Roman
Amphitheatre to be tortured for the Faith.
They made him hold burning coals in his
hands and told him that if he dropped them
he was giving incense to the idols. He held
the coals until they burned right through his
hand. A martyr. His picture was hanging
on the wall of the class room. An angel was
placing a crown on his head and he looked&mdash;happy!</p>

<p>"I've been a pretty tough nut," Bill
soliloquized, "guess this is my punishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
That martyr kid didn't do any harm. I've
done a lot. The fellows aren't a bad set. They
gave me a pretty good show. They didn't
butt in on the fight. What grit that Mulvy
has! I'd have given up, if he was on top&mdash;but
not him! Gee&mdash;the way he just squirmed
from under, and started in, as if only beginning.
No wonder he plays football! A
fellow's eyes tell you when you can't lick
him. And cool as a cucumber! And then&mdash;'Let's
shake!' 'Some boy' that Mulvy kid!
And what a cur I was to go and smash things
the way I did! And spoil the fellows having the
McCormack treat. I'm pretty 'yellow'. And
then Father Boone comes over and straightens
things out and puts Dad on his feet!</p>

<p>"Well, I'm through with the roughneck
stuff. Pretty painful&mdash;but you don't catch
me groaning again. I'll 'offer it up', like
Sister said, for the love of God, to atone for
my sins. I've got the sins all right. So here
goes for the 'offer up' part. No more grunts,
Bill Daly."</p>

<p>He had hardly finished his resolve to bear
his pain patiently and without murmur, as an
offering to God, when the doctor and nurse
approached his bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sonny," began the doctor, "you
did quite a circus stunt, I'm told."</p>

<p>Bill grinned for reply, as the doctor proceeded
to examine him. It was necessary to
press and probe and lift and handle him generally.
Every pressure and every slightest
movement caused him exquisite pain. But
not a murmur escaped him. Once or twice
there was an "Oh!" in spite of his best
efforts, but not a complaint nor a whimper.
Doctor and nurse were surprised. Finally,
the doctor said, "Son, either you are not
much hurt or you are the pluckiest lad I've
ever examined."</p>

<p>"I don't know about the pluck, doctor,"
he replied, "but I do know that if I were
hurt much more, it would be all over with
me."</p>

<p>He had hardly finished the words when he
fainted. When he came to, the doctor said,
"Boy, nothing but dynamite can kill you, and
I want to tell you that your name is pluck."
They left him for a few minutes and when the
nurse returned, she remarked: "You are not
seriously injured, but you will be pretty sore
for some days, and I want to tell you, you
are a little hero."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>When she was gone, Bill mused: "I wonder
what she'd say to the 'little hero,' if she saw
that damaged room and knew it was spite?
I'm getting mine. I'll cut out the 'hero' stuff,
for a while anyway."</p>

<p>About an hour later, as he was lying quietly
on his back, he was delighted to see his mother
coming towards him. The sudden movement
he made, hurt him dreadfully but he quickly
mastered himself, and gave no indication
whatever of the pain he experienced. The
nurse had given the mother strict orders not
to touch him but, when she saw her Willie
there before her, the great love she bore him
made her forget everything. She threw her
arms about him and before he could say a
word, had given him a hug and a hearty kiss.
It was almost as bad as the doctor's examination.
Willie writhed in pain, but he uttered
no complaint.</p>

<p>"O my dear, dear boy," exclaimed Mrs.
Daly, seeing his efforts at suppressing the
pain. "The nurse told me not to touch you,
and here I've almost squeezed the life out of
you, and made you suffer in every part of
your body."</p>

<p>His suffering was so intense that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
some minutes before Bill could reply to her.
At length he said, "O mother, I'm so glad to
see you. It seems so long since I left the
house yesterday and, mother, life seems so
different."</p>

<p>This exhausted him. He just lay still, his
mother's hand on his forehead, and her eyes
looking into his. In his weakened state, tears
soon gathered, not of pain, but of gratefulness,
of emotion from a high resolve to bury
the old Bill Daly and to live anew.</p>

<p>By degrees they began to talk. She told
him of the night before, and the meeting with
the boy at the office below, and his kindness
to her. Bill was all interest. She could not
recall the boy's name and she was a poor hand
at description. Bill mentioned a number of
his corner chums. The Club boys did not even
enter his head. "Think hard, mother, and
see if you can't get it. I want to know. I
didn't think anyone cared so much for me."</p>

<p>"O yes, now I remember," she replied,
"When Father Boone came in he called him
Frank."</p>

<p>That was too much for Bill. He thought of
a thousand things all at once. His mother,
only half understanding, continued: "He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
one of the nicest boys I ever saw. When we
got to our house, he took me by the hand and
says, 'Don't worry, Mrs. Daly. You've got
one of the finest boys in the world, and he'll
be home with you soon,' and his voice as kind
and as tender as a woman's, God bless him!"</p>

<p>Bill was still thinking. This was the boy he
had provoked to fight, the one who had had
to take the brunt of the director's anger!
Mrs. Daly was rambling on when Bill looked
up and asked her if Father Boone had been
around.</p>

<p>She was not a little surprised. "Didn't
you know about him, dear?" she inquired.
Then she proceeded to tell everything in detail,
from the time that Father Boone brought
her the news until he closed the taxi door and
sent her home with Frank. The narration
seemed to Bill like a story from a book. He
had the illusion, again, of not being a party
to the events at all, but just a spectator.
Then the thought of his ingratitude came back
full force. The kindly and tactful deeds of
Father Boone bored into his soul like a red
hot iron. What an ingrate he was. Hero!
indeed. Such a hero!</p>

<p>While he was thus reflecting, the nurse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
came over and informed his mother that it was
time to go now, as the doctors would be in
soon. Reluctantly she bade good-bye to her
boy. Wiser by experience, she did not embrace
him, but just bent low and kissed him
gently on the forehead.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>The doctors made their usual round of the
ward, and when they came to Daly, the
physician who had dressed his bruises the
night before remarked, "Here's the hero kid."
The head doctor looked at him kindly. "Well,
little man," he said, "the next time you go
to a fire, send us word so we can see you perform."
They all laughed at this, and Bill
smiled. After the examination, the doctor
assured him, "Nothing the matter, my boy.
You're sound as a dollar, just a little shaken
up and bruised; and you'll be out in a few
days."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Daly came in again about four
o'clock in the afternoon, she was over-joyed
to hear the good report of her son's condition.
She saw now, however, that he was very
serious. Indeed, it had been the most serious
day of his life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>All day long Bill had been reflecting on
what his mother had told him of Father Boone
and of Frank. He had begun to realize that
he had something to do besides being grateful
to them both. There was a duty to perform.
It had been hard to go to the Club when he
intended to tell them about the breakage.
And now it seemed ten times harder. How
could he do it? After all the goodness shown
him, to be obliged to admit that he was a
thug. The thought had tortured him all the
day. It was still racking his mind when his
mother came in.</p>

<p>If only Father Boone would come around,
he reflected. It would be easier to make a
clean breast of it to him. He would understand.
Father Boone seemed to understand
everything. He'd see, too, that the Bill who
had done the rough stuff was changed. He'd
know without a lot of explaining, how some
things hurt more than pain. The thing to do
was to tell Father Boone and let it all rest
with him.</p>

<p>That was Bill's conclusion and his resolve.
He did not dare tell his mother. He wondered
how much the boys knew. His mother,
sitting admiringly at his side, told him one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
piece of news which pleased him greatly.
Father Boone had got his father a good job
and he had started in right away. That was
why he was not down with her to see him.
But he would be around in the evening. While
she was telling this, Bill interrupted her.</p>

<p>"O mother, see," he whispered, indicating
two nuns who were coming toward them,
"and one of them is Sister Mary Thomas."</p>

<p>They were Sisters from the school which
Daly had attended before he went to work,
and they greeted the mother and her boy
sympathetically. After a bit, Mrs. Daly
recalled that her husband returning from
work would be waiting for his dinner, and
she hurried away. The Sisters stayed for some
time, giving Bill that comfort which they
alone can impart. Before going Sister Mary
Thomas placed a crucifix and a pair of beads
in his hands. "He suffered for you, William,"
she said, "and you must also suffer for Him&mdash;now
especially."</p>

<p>He watched them going out, as he might
gaze on departing angels. Then his eyes were
turned toward the crucifix. "He suffered in
mind as well as body for me," he mused. For
Bill was remembering many things now, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he had not recalled since the Sisters had
taught them to him in his school days.
Calvary had a meaning for him now&mdash;an
atonement for sin and a restoration to goodness.
"Some job&mdash;to tell on myself," he
sighed, "but I'll show the Lord that I mean
business."</p>

<p>About seven o'clock in came Frank. Bill
was both glad, and not glad, to see him.
Everything Frank did for him only made
matters harder for Bill. And yet he wanted
that boy near him. Bill recognized the combination
of strength and goodness in Frank.
Indeed, one reason for the fight, had been his
envy of Mulvy. But Bill's disposition had
undergone a change. After what his mother
had told him Frank appeared as a boy of
nobler mould than the rest.</p>

<p>Frank began with an offhand, "Well, how
goes it, old man?"</p>

<p>"Fine," answered Bill.</p>

<p>"You're all right, Bill. Your stock is pretty
high now at the Club."</p>

<p>But Bill was thinking of other things than
compliments, and after a moment's silence,
Frank decided that the patient was suffering
a good deal, and that he'd better go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, don't go yet, Mulvy," Bill begged,
"stay with a fellow a little while."</p>

<p>"Why, you are crying, old man," said
Frank, as he looked into his face, "you must
be suffering terribly. It takes a lot of pain to
make you cry."</p>

<p>"It's not pain," he whispered. "It's something
worse."</p>

<p>"O, I know, old fellow. You're thinking
about your father and mother. But you're
not seriously hurt, the nurse told me. Father
Boone has been around to see your folks, and
he has made them feel all right."</p>

<p>"It's something worse than that," answered
Daly. "If I told you, you'd cut me dead, and
so would the other fellows."</p>

<p>"Come now, old chap, you are not yourself.
You've nothing to worry over. You're a guy
that's got sand."</p>

<p>This had a reassuring effect on Bill. A
doctor or a nurse might compliment him, but
what do they know? But when a boy tells
you you have "sand," that's different!</p>

<p>Frank was soon relating to him the fall into
the net&mdash;the first account Daly had heard of
it. Frank went on to tell about the ambulance
and Father Boone, and the priest's visit to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
parents, and again how the priest came late
at night and went up to see him, his kind
words to his mother, and finally his sending
her home in the taxi. It all seemed like a
movie to Daly.</p>

<p>For some time he lay perfectly quiet. Then,
although it cost him a deal of pain, he reached
for Frank's hand and grasped it firmly. Their
eyes met. Bill felt a great yearning to tell
Frank everything. He had fully determined
to tell only Father Boone. Even that would
be hard. But now he really wanted to tell
Frank. It would be such a relief!</p>

<p>While they were still grasping hands, he
began, pausing after each sentence and speaking
with an effort:</p>

<p>"Mulvy, I'm a cur .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don't stop me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I'm worse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me go on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I've got to get this off my mind or bust .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I'm bad, clean through, but from now on,
never again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You've got a good home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You don't know what mine was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. drunkenness,
fights and the like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I've lived in the
streets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing but roughnecks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
became the worst of the lot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My Dad was
sent to jail .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ma and me were in a bad
way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no money for rent or food .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Somehow Father Boone turned up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
helped us out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then he got me a job .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
After that he put me in the Club .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
didn't fit there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Something you don't know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hated the
bunch because they were decent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. picked
a fight with you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You licked me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes
you did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had to clear out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I was
yellow and a thug .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I fought underhand
against you all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I did the meanest thing
out."</p>

<p>At this point Frank tried to remonstrate
with him, but at the same time he was keenly
interested in what was coming.</p>

<p>"I hated the whole bunch and Father Boone
and everybody. So when the crowd left, I
sneaked back and broke a lot of chairs, overturned
tables, tore down pictures, threw over
the victrola, spilled ink on the floor. I knew
it'd queer the crowd with Father Boone and
spoil the McCormack treat. I got square
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, someone else has got square
too. There are different kinds of pain, and my
worst now is not my injuries."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Frank was
too much amazed to say a word. Bill continued:
"I'm taking my medicine. If I'm not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the right sort the rest of my life, I hope to be
cut and quartered. Look at Father Boone
right afterwards helping my Dad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He'n' I
had a terrible scrap. We'd have killed each
other only for mother. Then she got Father
Boone to come over. I don't know what he
did&mdash;but&mdash;well, it was all different when I
got back. Dad put out his hand to me. We
knelt down. Said the 'Hail Holy Queen.'
Father took the pledge. I felt like a whipped
cur, all next day. I saw I'd have to square
myself at any cost. That's why I came to the
Club. You know the rest."</p>

<p>Here he paused, heaved a sigh, and
exclaimed, "O God, what a relief."</p>

<p>Frank's feelings can be imagined. Here
was the key to the mystery, and Father Boone
justified. Apparently he had known all about
the wreck&mdash;and it was natural to suppose
that it was the work of a crowd. What a
surprise to the director to see that damaged
room! And worse&mdash;no explanation. It was
all clear to Frank now. The fog was lifted.
The missing parts of the picture fitted into
place. But what of Father Boone?</p>

<p>After a brief silence, which seemed to both
a very long while, Frank gave an extra squeeze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to Daly's hand and said, "It's all right, Bill,
we'll stand together. You can count on me
to the limit."</p>

<p>The look of gratitude in Daly's face told
Frank that there was now a special bond
between them.</p>

<p>"You have told me so much, old man," he
said, "that I suppose you won't mind if I ask
you a few questions?"</p>

<p>"All you want," replied Daly.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, does Father Boone know
anything about the affair?"</p>

<p>"Not as far as I know. I was intending to
tell him that night of the fire, but you saw
how it turned out. First I was going to tell
the fellows, and then see Father Boone and
squeal on myself to him."</p>

<p>"Daly&mdash;that was a dirty job .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it's
past and done. You're no longer yellow. Only
one in a million would come back as you're
doing. We're chums, Bill Daly, through thick
and thin."</p>

<p>"I like you for that, Mulvy, and I hope
you'll never regret it. Here's something," he
continued, timidly showing the crucifix in his
other hand. "I've promised Him, never a
crooked thing again,&mdash;and a promise to Him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
means no going back." They joined hands&mdash;and
hearts. They were comrades now. With
a look which showed that the past was buried,
Frank tenderly said,</p>

<p>"How's the pain, old man?"</p>

<p>"Well, since I've told you so much, I'll tell
you a little more. It's something awful. I'm
not doing any baby stunts,&mdash;but&mdash;just the
same I've got an awful dose. While on the
broad of my back, thinking, and in pain, I
remembered that martyr boy the Sister told
us about, who held the burning coals in his
hands, and I said to myself, 'Bill Daly, that
kid didn't have your score, but see what he
endured for God.' And that's when I promised.
I just told Him I deserved it all, I'd take
it for penance, and I promised to cut out the
cry-baby stuff."</p>

<p>"Daly, you're a brick."</p>

<p>To which Bill rejoined, "And Mulvy, you're
all gold&mdash;twenty-two carat."</p>

<p>"You'll get over that, Daly," replied Frank.
"I must be going now. Mum is the word.
What you've told me, is the same as not said.
I'll not breathe it to a living soul."</p>

<p>A tempest raged in Frank's soul. His was a
magnanimous character, and it pained him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
think that circumstances should have framed
for Father Boone, such a strong case against
him. The director had placed absolute confidence
in him. No wonder he showed such
indignation. "And wasn't it just like Father
Boone&mdash;to turn in a half dozen men and fix
things up at once, and then wait for developments
as if nothing had happened!"</p>

<p>Frank made his way toward the Club.
"If I can get hold of the janitor," he thought,
"I can find out all I want to know." He
turned off to the street where the janitor
lived, and soon found his man.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Dunn," he began.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir."</p>

<p>In an apparently indifferent manner, Frank
led up to his objective. But old Dunn suspected
something right from the start. It is
true that Father Boone had not imposed
silence in regard to the mischief at the Club,
but the janitor was a sensible and loyal man,
and he judged that if Father Boone wanted
anything to be said about the affair, he would
say it himself. The indifference that Dunn displayed
whenever Frank tried to lead up to
the point, was amazing. The boy finally gave
up the flank attack and tried the front.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Dunn, that was quite a bit of damage
we had over there the other day, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite a bit," said Dunn, "but I guess
Daly was not hurt as badly as we thought
at first."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't refer to the fire, but to the
Club," observed Frank.</p>

<p>"There was no fire at the Club, as far as I
know," remarked Dunn.</p>

<p>"No, but there was a whole lot of breakage
over there, and you know all about it. Now,
how in the name of Sam Hill did they fix
things up by the time we got there in the
evening?"</p>

<p>"Young man, if you want to know anything
about the Club, I think you'll find
Father Boone in his office at his usual hours.
And now good night!"</p>

<p>"By gum," muttered Frank, "the old
snoozer's no fool. I'll bet if he had an education,
he'd be on top somewhere."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Father Boone was in the Club
office attending to the little matters that
came up daily. He was poring over a letter
which had come in the afternoon mail. It was
written on exceptionally fine paper, and was
signed "James Roberts." The director indulged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in a moment's speculation. "Roberts,
Roberts," he reflected. "New name to me.
I wonder what he wants. I hope it's not a
complaint," he sighed, as he turned back to
the first page.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Reverend Sir:</p>

<p>I trust you will pardon my addressing
you without knowing your name. I am
sending this letter to the head of the
Boys' Club, as that is as definite as I can
be for the moment. Later, I hope to call
on you personally.</p>

<p>I have just returned from Cuba and
found my family in the Hotel Plaza
instead of at their home, where I left
them. They have informed me of what
you already know better than myself.
It was my house that was on fire, and my
wife and daughter attribute the saving of
their lives to a boy of your Club, who
hitched up the detached ladder, and in
doing so, met with such a dreadful
accident.</p>

<p>I've been home for only an hour, but
my first duty, I consider, is to convey to
you my gratitude and to inquire what I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
can do for the boy. If you will let me
know where he is, I shall have a trained
nurse sent to care for him, and I shall
consider it my privilege to do anything
else that is possible.</p>

<p>I await your reply.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Gratefully,</span><br />
James D. Roberts."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Father Boone never allowed his correspondence
to accumulate. Every evening saw
his desk cleared. No letter that called for a
reply was left over for the next day, if he
could possibly help it. He answered this
letter even before he read the rest which were
on the table before him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dear Mr. Roberts:</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your letter.
The boy is out of danger, and is getting
the best of care at the Lawrence Hospital.
I shall let him know of your kind
inquiry, and of your wish to be of assistance
to him.</p>

<p>With kindest regards,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Sincerely,</span><br />
Jerome Boone, S.J."<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good man to interest in Willie's family,"
he reflected, as he addressed the letter.</p>

<p>Father Boone was always planning how he
could help people. Every time he made the
acquaintance of anyone in a position of
authority or influence, he seized the opportunity
to remark:</p>

<p>"If you ever need a good bright boy, let me
know, and I shall send you one with whom
you will be satisfied."</p>

<p>In this way, he got many a boy placed in a
good position. Often, too, he got jobs for their
fathers. He was always so careful to recommend
only the right sort, that a word from
Father Boone was the best recommendation
a man or boy could have in getting work.</p>

<p>Just as he finished his letter to Mr. Roberts,
he heard a knock at his door, and a moment
later, a bright little chap of about thirteen
presented himself.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Vincent," said the priest.
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Please, Father," began the lad, "my father
is home from work three weeks now with
rheumatism, and mother says would you give
me a line to some place downtown to get a
job?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my little man, have you got your
working papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father, my mother went with me to
the City Hall this morning and got them."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Vinc., that a bright boy like
you must give up school so soon. But I suppose
your mother wouldn't do this unless she
had to. I'll get you a place, and then we must
see about your keeping up your studies at
night school." He wrote a line or two, and
addressing the envelope, gave it to the boy.</p>

<p>"Now, Vincent, I am sorry to do this, but
you just make the best of it. I'm sending you
to a very nice place with a good chance for
advancement. The pay is not much, but
you're only thirteen, and it's a fine start.
Now that you are starting out, mark well
what I say: Make yourself so useful that
when there is a vacancy higher up, you will be
the first boy they'll think about. And what
you do, do pleasantly. Good-bye and God
bless you. And," he added, as Vincent was
going out the door, "let me know from time
to time how you are doing."</p>

<p>The boy had gone but a few steps when,
with a jerk, he wheeled round and returned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
"O Father, excuse me," he faltered, "I forgot
to thank you."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the priest. "The
best way to thank me will be to let me hear a
good report of you."</p>

<p>The priest's next thought was, "I must
run down to the hospital, and see Willie.
But he does not worry me so much just now
as Frank does. I can't make out his conduct
in regard to this Club mix-up. He is certainly
an honorable boy and most considerate, and
yet he has left me in the dark all this time.
He knows that 'committees' are not my way
of doing business. After last night, I'd like
to drop the whole matter. But it is not an
affair of sentiment. I must see it through for
his sake, and for the sake of the rest also. If
nothing develops before tomorrow night, I'll
take the initiative myself. I hate that, and
I'd much rather they'd do the right thing of
their own accord. But,&mdash;" he shut down his
desk, put on his hat and coat, and started for
the hospital.</p>

<p>Frank, at the same time, was on his way
from Dunn's to the Club. Once more he was
going straight to the director,&mdash;to tell him
now, that there must be a misunderstanding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and that he was sorry to see him grieved.
He saw the director's point of view&mdash;of course
he couldn't explain&mdash;but perhaps Father
Boone would understand that he wasn't really
slipping so badly.</p>

<p>He was walking pretty fast, with his head
down, his chin buried in his coat collar, and
his hands deep in his pockets. Buried in his
thoughts, he did not see Father Boone approaching
on his way to the hospital. The
priest was almost on top of him before he was
aware of his presence. Looking up suddenly
he tipped his hat and stammered&mdash;"Good
evening, Father."</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," answered the priest
and hurried on.</p>

<p>Frank stopped. He was dumfounded.
"Good evening, <i>sir</i>! <i>Sir</i>, is it? So it's '<i>sir</i>'
now? Good evening, <i>sir</i>." He kept on repeating
the phrase, indignation following his
astonishment. He knew where the priest was
going, and realized that the interview with
him could not be held that evening. Another
day of torture stood before him. He was about
to give free rein to his feeling of injustice when
he recollected again that the priest with the
data he possessed was perfectly right in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
attitude. So, instead of going to the Club, he
turned aside and went into the church. It
was always open from five in the morning
until ten at night. Going up to the altar of
the Sacred Heart, he knelt down and prayed.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly he poured out his soul
to God, ending with the words, "Accept, O
Sacred Heart of Jesus, my sad heart as a
sacrifice and bless my father and mother and
Bill Daly and Father Boone."</p>

<p>So saying, he arose light-hearted and made
his way into the street. He actually began to
whistle, and when a boy whistles, he is all
right with the world. He did not mind now
how misunderstood he might be. It was no
longer a load of lead that weighed him down.
Rather, his sorrow had turned to gold. It
was something that God esteemed. He had
been able to give God something acceptable
to Him, because it had cost him a good deal.
That made him happy.</p>

<p>Father Boone was on his way to the hospital
when he had met Frank so abruptly. For an
instant he too had held his breath. Then as he
hurried on, he could not but wonder whether
Frank's chin in collar, hands deep in pockets
attitude, had meant that he was trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
slink past. Certainly his greeting had been
sudden and disturbed. "Well," declared the
priest to himself, "I'll settle this whole thing
tomorrow. It's gone on long enough."</p>

<p>Father Boone entered the hospital and
ascending the stairway leading to the office,
found himself before the Bureau of Information.</p>

<p>"How is that little fire hero?" he asked of
the clerk.</p>

<p>"I'll 'phone up and see," was the reply.</p>

<p>"O, don't mind, I am going right up. I
just asked because I thought you had news of
him here."</p>

<p>"It's only the serious patients whose condition
we have here, Father," answered the clerk.</p>

<p>"In that case," remarked the priest, "at
least he is not seriously ill; that is some news
anyway."</p>

<p>There was a sign on the door of the ward
saying: "<i>Closed</i>, doctors visiting." He knew
that this did not apply to him, as he was allowed
entrance any hour of the day or night.
Still, as it was not an urgent case, he decided
to wait until the doctors came out. The nurse
at the desk offered him her chair, which he
declined with thanks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, if you don't mind," he said, "I'll sit
on the edge of this table."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Father," she replied, "until I
run and get you a chair."</p>

<p>"No, no," he protested, "I like this much
better."</p>

<p>So the ice was broken.</p>

<p>"You have got one of my little fellows inside,"
he continued. "How is he getting
along?"</p>

<p>"You mean that Daly boy?"</p>

<p>He nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Why, we are all in love with him. He is
one grand boy. This morning the doctor had
to remove some loose skin from his arm, and
he found that he would have to do a little
cutting of the flesh to get at some of the skin
which had become imbedded. The boy heard
him say to me, 'It will hurt him like the mischief.'
The lad spoke up, 'Go ahead, Doc. If
you can stand it, I guess I can.'</p>

<p>"The doctor didn't want to use cocaine on
it, so he took the boy at his word. It was
simply terrific, Father! We had to pull the
skin out with pincers. He just tightened his
jaws, and never let out a moan. That boy is
a credit to you. He has always taken just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
what was given him and has been no trouble
to anybody."</p>

<p>As Father Boone was getting ready to reply,
the doctors passed into the next ward.</p>

<p>The priest went in at once to see his patient.
Daly's eyes, as big as saucers, greeted him.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a nice scare you gave us all,
you little rascal," was the priest's greeting.
All Bill could do was grin. "They tell me
there is nothing the matter with you, that
you are just a bit frightened."</p>

<p>"O, I don't know about the frightened
part," rejoined Daly, "I guess there was somebody
else in that boat, as well as myself."</p>

<p>"My boy, I want to congratulate you. Not
on your ladder stunt, anyone could do that,
and not fall off, either; but on your fortitude
here. True, there are no bones broken or
anything like that, but you've had a lot of
acute pain to endure, and they tell me you
have not whimpered. You have given the
Club a good name here. William, I am proud
of you."</p>

<p>Poor Bill! All day long he had been fortifying
his resolution to tell Father Boone everything.
But after this praise from the priest,
he could no more touch on the affair than fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Two or three times he made an attempt to
begin, but the words stuck in his throat.
They talked on a lot of things, but after that
first allusion to the Club, there did not seem
to be another opening for Bill. At last, however,
he made one great effort.</p>

<p>"Father," he cried out, "there is something
on my mind, I must let it out! It's got me all
on fire inside. I'll burn up unless I out with
it."</p>

<p>Father Boone could see his excitement and
knowing that the boy was in an overwrought
condition, which must not be made worse,
took him quietly by the hand, patted his
head and said, "Now that's all right, Willie.
Don't take things to heart so much; we'll have
a good talk when you are yourself again."
He saw Bill look steadily into his eyes and
swallow once or twice, but he did not understand
that the words of an accusation were
sticking in the boy's throat and blocking his
speech. So thinking that the lad had need of
rest and quiet, he spoke a few kindly words
and withdrew.</p>

<p>Daly felt like calling after him, but before
he could make up his mind, Father Boone had
gone. Usually, the priest did not leave a bedside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
without suggesting confession, if the patient
were at all seriously ill. Even if the illness
were slight, he frequently took occasion
of it to reconcile the sick person with God, and
to bring into the soul that comfort which goes
so far to restore health to the body, besides
bringing solace and healing to the mind. But
as director of the Club, he felt a special delicacy
in suggesting confession to one of his
boys, and since, just now, Bill had seemed
bordering on hysteria, the priest believed that
a little reassurance was the proper thing.</p>

<p>"The poor boy got a worse shaking up than
he is aware of," he thought, "but it will pass
off soon. I shall see him tomorrow, and arrange
to bring him Holy Communion. The
dear Lord will do the rest." So he hastened
home.</p>

<p>Daly, meanwhile, had quieted down somewhat.
But reflections came thick and fast.
"Father Boone congratulated me, did he?
If he only knew what he was congratulating!
Yes, I'm a brave boy! Couldn't open my
mouth. Mulvy would act that way,&mdash;not!
I wish I had a little of his 'sand.' Gee, next
time I've got to get it out&mdash;even if it chokes
me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned over and tried to sleep. The lights
were low in the ward now, and a great quiet
reigned. But sleep would not come. He began
by counting sheep going through a gate. One,
two, three&mdash;he got up to a hundred, and there
before his eyes was a big black sheep stuck
in the gate. "That's me," he uttered, and
stopped the count. Then he tried going up a
very high stairs, counting the steps one by
one. At last he got to the top and looking
about he saw a room, in disorder. Broken
chairs, upset tables, pictures on the floor,
and a boy spilling ink. "That's me," he
sighed. Then he rehearsed all that his mother
and Frank had told him of Father Boone's
kindness. He saw the ambulance rushing
along and the priest watching tenderly over
an unconscious form. "That's me," he
thought to himself.</p>

<p>He began to feel very thirsty. "I wish I
had a drink," he sighed. An hour passed, two,
three. He heard the clock strike twelve. A
nurse was passing. He called to her and asked
her for a drink of water. She drew near to
him, observed his dry hot face and glistening
eyes. His tongue was parched and thick.
She felt his pulse. Then she took out a thermometer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and put it in his mouth. He submitted
patiently to it all, but when the thermometer
was withdrawn, he said beseechingly,
"Please give me a drink."</p>

<p>The nurse assured him that she would attend
to him and left his side. Going to her
desk in the corridor, she called the house
surgeon. "I think, doctor," she told him over
the phone, "you'd better come up. That
Daly boy has quite a temperature." The
doctor was soon in consultation with her, and
together they went to the patient. After a
careful inspection, they withdrew.</p>

<p>"Typhoid," exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>"I was afraid so," she replied.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<h3>The Field of Honor</h3>


<p>The next morning Father Boone, in his
office, at the Club, sent for Thomas Dunn.
When the janitor came, the priest said, "It
is several days now since that room was
upset. I expected the boys to report it at
once. But not even the officials have said a
word to me yet. I know I could find out about
it if I wished to quiz them, but I don't want
to do that. It may have been some sort of a
mix-up in which the fellows all feel that to
say a word about it would be mean. They may
not take the serious view of it that I do. So
now I am going to start in, in my own way,
to get at the bottom of it. And I begin with
you. Have you observed anything that would
give me a clue?"</p>

<p>"Well no, I can't say that I have," replied
Dunn. "The lads have been unusually well
behaved since that night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, but if you should come across
anything that will throw light on the mystery,
let me know."</p>

<p>Dunn turned to go, but suddenly recollected
something. "I don't know whether it's much
of a clue, Father, or if it's worth while mentioning,
but one of the boys was over to my
house last night seeming to want me to talk
on the matter."</p>

<p>"Why, that's a straw that shows how the
wind blows. Who was the boy?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Father, I don't know the
boys much by name. But as he was going
out I called my boy Harry and I says to him,
'Harry, who is that chap, do you know'?</p>

<p>"'Yes, Pa,' he says, and he gave me his
name, but I forget it. I'll have to ask Harry,
if you like, and let you know this evening."</p>

<p>"Very well, Thomas, do so."</p>

<p>Dunn left, and was half way downstairs
when he turned back again. "Pardon me,
Father, but I think I've got the name or near
it. Harry said the boy was Murray, but I'm
not quite sure, but it was Murray, or Murphy,
or Mulvy or some such name."</p>

<p>At the name Mulvy, an electric spark
seemed to pass through the director. Dunn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
did not notice it, as he went out at once.
He caught the words "Thank you, Thomas,"
as he was leaving the room, and that was all.</p>

<p>But Father Boone! This was adding insult
to injury! So Mulvy did know something
about it! And instead of coming to the director,
he had gone over to the janitor! A
nice way for a trusted and honorable boy to
act!</p>

<p>Father Boone had been trying all along to
convince himself that somehow Mulvy would
come out of it clear and clean. He had thought
of a thousand excuses for the delay&mdash;questions
of divided allegiance or some point or other
of honor and so on. But Mulvy's going to the
janitor to get information looked like an
underhand mission, certainly. What for?&mdash;To
find out what the director knew, or how
he had taken it&mdash;or to arrange some explanation?</p>

<p>All these questions shot through his mind
with the rapidity of lightning. None of them
carried its own answer. All of them seemed
out of harmony with what he knew of Mulvy.
And yet, there were the facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>The parochial school was around the corner
from the church and club and it was at this
very hour that the department of which young
Harry Dunn was a member had been turned
loose in the play yard for recess. A game of
tag was soon on, and Dunn, dodging in and
out, ran right into Ned Mullen. The collision
sent Dunn sprawling to the ground. He was
two years younger than Ned, but very stocky.
It was nobody's fault that he got the bump;
but nevertheless as soon as he rose to his
feet, he rushed at Ned and gave him a kick in
the shins. Ned's first impulse was to box his
ears, but as the boy was so small, he merely
took hold of him and gave him a good shaking.</p>

<p>Dunn began to blubber. In a thrice a crowd
gathered, and Dunn, seeing that he was being
teased, got ugly. Turning to Ned, who was
about to back off with Tommy, he cried out:
"Yes, you belong to the crowd that smashed
up things! Father Boone will fix you!"</p>

<p>The threat didn't mean much to Tommy
and Ned and they walked away.</p>

<p>Harry Dunn, however, had heard just
enough from his father about the Club damage
to think he could best get even by telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his teacher about it. So, when the boys got
into their school rooms again, he tried to tell
the Sister that two fellows had thrown him
down in the yard. She paid no attention to
him. After class, he went to her again, and
said that the boys who broke things at the
Club were trying to pick on him. "Mind your
own business, Harry," she said, "and nobody
will pick on you, you little tattletale." As the
boys say, he got "his."</p>

<p>That afternoon Father Boone, passing
through the school after class, stopped to talk
to the Sister in the vestibule. Just then along
came young Dunn.</p>

<p>"Here's a young gentleman who is talking
about a row at the Club," she said to the
priest, as she held the lad by her eye. She
thought the boy had made a mountain out
of a mole hill, and that the director's shrug
or laugh would show the youngster where he
stood. Instead, Father Boone grew instantly
serious. The Sister saw she had made a mistake,
but before she could change the subject,
he said, disregarding the boy:</p>

<p>"It was bad business, Sister. I feel ashamed
and hurt about it. I did not think my boys
would act so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he continued, "But how did you know
about it, Sister?"</p>

<p>"O, a little bird told me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and may I ask what the little
bird told you?"</p>

<p>"Really, Father, it's not worth while referring
to. I shouldn't have recalled it but for
that young lad who passed us this moment.
You know him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do."</p>

<p>"He is Harry Dunn, Father, the son of your
janitor."</p>

<p>"O, that's interesting, Sister; so it seems
that I know less&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment he was interrupted by a
messenger who told him that he was wanted
for a sick call. He hurried to the rectory.
A woman in the parlor was waiting to give
him the name and address of a sick person.
"Why, that," he exclaimed, "is the house
where the Dalys live."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father."</p>

<p>"How old is this boy you say is so ill?"</p>

<p>"About twelve, Father."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether he is seriously ill;
has the doctor been there?"</p>

<p>"O yes, Father, and he said the boy had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
typhoid. There is another case in the house
also, and the Board of Health has been
around."</p>

<p>He promised to go at once to administer
the consolations of religion to the sick boy.
"I am glad the Board of Health is on the
ground," he said to himself, as he was on his
way over. "From what I saw of conditions
there, it's a wonder they're not all down with
typhoid. I suppose Willie would have had it,
except that he is such a robust and active
lad."</p>

<p>When the priest had finished his ministrations,
he went up to the Daly flat. After his
knock at the door, he heard quick movements
inside and then a rather long silence. He
rapped again. This time the door was opened
and Mrs. Daly met him. The reason for the
delay was evident. She had been crying and
did not care to exhibit herself to a neighbor.
But on seeing Father Boone she broke out
afresh, at the same time showing him a telegram
she had just received from the hospital.
It read: "William Daly dangerously ill.
You will be admitted any hour." It was
signed by the superintendent.</p>

<p>Father Boone put two and two together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
"Typhoid." He made up his mind at once
just what to do. "You stay here until I send
a cab for you; then come along." He himself
hurried downstairs, walked quickly over to
the trolley and in ten minutes was at the
hospital. Not until he got there did he go to
the phone and call up a taxi for Mrs. Daly.
He had a good start now, and could pave the
way for her.</p>

<p>Going immediately to the ward, he found
the nurse at Daly's bedside. "Rather sudden,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"Very," she replied.</p>

<p>"There were no signs last night, nurse, as
far as I could see. What seems to be the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Typhoid."</p>

<p>All this was in a whisper.</p>

<p>He continued, "I'll just see how he is and
say a few words to him before his mother
comes."</p>

<p>"He is delirious, Father."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll know me," he said, and bent
over the patient. He took his hand gently,
saying, "Willie boy, you have not said 'hello'
to me yet." No answer. "You know Father
Boone, don't you, Willie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Frank," was the response. "I wish
I had your 'sand.' I say, Frank," he continued,
"I'm starting right when this thing is
over." He paused for a moment and then
resumed. "I don't blame the fellows. I'm
down on myself now." Another pause.
"Frank, you tell Father Boone I'm sorry. I
want to see him. You are a brick. I am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
O, I'll tell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the whole thing if it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
chokes me." This last was said with an effort.</p>

<p>Father Boone attributed all he was saying
to delirium. He realized that the patient's
condition was serious, and prepared to give
him the Last Sacraments. As he took out the
Holy Oils, and was about to anoint him the
boy's eyes looked calmly at him and he uttered
the words: "Hello, Father."</p>

<p>The priest was very glad that the boy was
conscious, and not knowing how long he would
remain so, he started to hear his confession as
quickly as possible. He began by receiving
from him a general acknowledgment of his
sins and contrition for them, intending, if
time permitted, to hear his confession in
detail. "You are sorry for all the sins of your
life, my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say the Act of Contrition."</p>

<p>He began: "O my God, I am most heartily
sorry for all my sins and I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>When Father Boone saw that William was
lapsing into unconsciousness, he took a crucifix
and holding it to the boy's lips, said, "Kiss
the crucifix, my child, and say, 'Jesus have
mercy on me.'" As he gave him absolution,
he heard him murmur, "Jesus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have
mer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." and off he fell again into delirium.</p>

<p>The priest was sorry that the confession had
been cut short, but was very glad that he was
able to give him absolution. Then he anointed
him, for Daly's condition did not permit of
his receiving Holy Viaticum. The priest had
barely finished the administration of the last
rites, when Mrs. Daly appeared. He quickly
approached her and cautioned her sternly
not to show emotion in the presence of the
patient, as any excitement would only make
his condition worse.</p>

<p>"O my Willie, my Willie," was her answer,
and her body shook with emotion. "Willie was
the good boy, he was the good boy to his
mother. O blessed Mother, help me now in
my hour."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The first burst of grief over, she really
showed wonderful control and approached the
bed quite calmly. Bill was now sleeping.
The mother sat by his side with her hand on
his. Seeing that the priest was waiting, she
said, "Are you waiting to give him the
Sacraments, Father?"</p>

<p>"No, I have already done that," he replied,
"but, if you don't mind, I'll wait for you."</p>

<p>"No, no, Father dear," she said, "don't
wait for me, for I am afraid it would be a long
wait."</p>

<p>He considered for a moment, and decided
to leave.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(III)</div>

<p>On his way home, Father Boone had time
to review the occurrence at the school earlier
in the day. It was the Dunn boy whom the
Sister had pointed out, as she told him the
little incident. He said the Club boys were
"picking on him." It could be that they were
retaliating for something connected with the
Club affair. He did not like the set of things.
But if he could have seen what was occurring
in some other quarters, he might have liked
the looks of things still less.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>After school, Ned and Tommy sought
Frank. The Regal High was but a short distance
from the parochial school.</p>

<p>"Say, Frank," began Ned, "that Dunn kid
is a fresh guy. Today, after bumping into
Tommy and me, he got ugly and gave me a
kick. I shook him up a bit, and he starts in
and blabs about the fight with you and 'Bull.'
Afterwards, he told the Sister about it, only
he made it ten times worse than it was. To
hear him talk you would think we had a free
fight over there. He spoke of breaking things
and a lot of stuff like that."</p>

<p>Of course Frank saw at once what had happened.
Harry had heard his father mention
the damaged room. He kept his surmises
to himself, however, replying, "O, don't
mind that fellow, he's only a kid."</p>

<p>"But, Frank," continued Ned, "if you
heard how the thing has spread and how your
name is mixed up in it, you'd mind."</p>

<p>Frank laughed off this observation, and
tried to turn the talk to something else. But
as they walked along, they were stopped by at
least three different boys who asked what the
row at the Club had been.</p>

<p>By that time Frank began to get anxious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The mix-up was bad enough to face when only
the Club and Father Boone and his mother
knew. How could the explanation ever catch
up with the story&mdash;especially if young Dunn
got to talking! Of course, in the end everything
would come out all right. In due time,
Father Boone would learn the truth from
Daly himself, but meanwhile&mdash;</p>

<p>He knew his mother was as much upset
about the misunderstanding as himself. And
to have affairs still further complicated would
be pretty bad. Father Boone must know a
good deal, for the place could not have been
set right without his knowledge. But he did
not know who had done it, nor any of the
details. That was evident from Daly's story,
and so up to now, he was angry with Frank
because he had not reported. It had all the
evidences of a free row surely&mdash;and his indignation
was justified&mdash;and especially against
an official. But now suppose this talk should
reach Father Boone and that it should associate
him with the affair as one of its leaders!</p>

<p>The very thought made Frank shudder,
until he recalled that Bill was not only willing,
but anxious to make a clean breast of his
spiteful deed. So in the end, all would turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
out right. For the time being, he was under a
cloud. There was nothing to do but wait
for the wind to blow it away or the sun to
dissipate it.</p>

<p>But even as he meditated, the cloud was
getting thicker and blacker. He had hardly
returned to school for the afternoon session,
when his teacher asked him if the report were
true, that he was deposed from his office as
secretary. The inquiry gave him a distinct
shock. He had the greatest respect and affection
for his professor, and that Mr. Collins
should entertain for a moment the thought
that he had done anything to deserve the censure
of Father Boone, was very painful to
him.</p>

<p>"This is the first I have heard of it,"
Frank answered.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I was misinformed," was the
reply.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Frank's thoughts could not
be held in check. There was just the possibility
that Father Boone had taken some
further action. When his name was called
for recitation in Caesar his mind was elsewhere.
It was not like Frank to hesitate when
called upon, but now he was at sea. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
teacher saw his predicament, and having
genuine regard for him said, "Don't you
agree with the preceding translation? Smith,
try that passage again." Smith repeated
and Frank, now master of the situation, took
up the portion assigned him. But his mind
soon wandered away again. He began to
reflect on the consideration his teacher had
shown him, and to wonder if his absent-mindedness
suggested the disquiet of a guilty
conscience. It seemed as though every fellow
in the class was watching him.</p>

<p>When school was out, he went to Mr.
Collins to thank him. "I was all upset, sir,
by what you said before class."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Frank, that I referred to the
matter at all. I really was sure, knowing you
as I do, that it was a false rumor."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Collins."</p>

<p>After school, Frank went straight to the
Club to see if Father Boone were there, and
to find out from him if there were anything
back of the report. The priest was not in his
office. Frank turned into the reading room and
from force of habit went to look at the notice
board where the items of interest to the Club
were usually posted. To his amazement he read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Office of Secretary is hereby
discontinued. Members will hereafter
deal personally with the Director.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Jerome Boone."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Frank's head was in a whirl. He began to
get dizzy. Falling back into a chair, he repeated
again and again: "The office of Secretary
is hereby discontinued." "A direct
slap!" he gasped. "Condemned unheard. It
is not fair. That's no way to deal with a
fellow. It's an outrage. I did not believe that
Father Boone could do such a thing. Condemned,
disgraced and the whole parish
talking about it! It will cut my mother to the
very heart. I've got to keep it from her&mdash;to
put a stop to it right now. I'll go to the
rectory and have it out with him. This is
what I get for not taking a firm stand in the
beginning."</p>

<p>He sat with his head on his arms on the
table. His inclination was to give way to his
feelings, but after a moment, he jumped up,
stood erect and exclaimed, "I'll win out."</p>

<p>He started for the rectory, but on his way,
he began to hesitate. "What grievance have
I got anyway? When it comes down to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
'kicking,' what 'kick' have I got coming?
From Daly's own story, there was an awful
job done. No one on earth could believe it the
work of one or two. Father Boone naturally
expected some word from me. And if old
Dunn told him I was over there pumping
him&mdash;? That was a bad move&mdash;puts me in
deeper. Young Dunn was only repeating what
he got from his father. It certainly looks bad.
And if I start something, what can I say?
I'd be cornered, no matter which way I'd
turn. The only thing to do is to lie low for a
while, and let things shape themselves. Daly'll
tell the whole thing himself and then it will
be my turn. And then Father Boone&mdash;gee&mdash;I'll
feel sorry for him then!" So Frank put
off his visit to the priest and went home.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IV)</div>

<p>If Frank had experienced a sense of relief
in deciding not to see the priest, it was short-lived.
He walked into his home, and faced
Father Boone and his mother engaged in
serious conversation. His heart leaped into
his mouth. The worst had happened! The
priest evidently considered this affair so
serious that he had come to see his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
And it would break her heart to have a priest
complain of him! And especially Father Boone&mdash;that
would be a dagger thrust! These and
like thoughts flashed through his mind in an
instant.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Frank's deductions
were all wrong. Mrs. Mulvy was the President
of the Parish Relief Association of which
Father Boone had charge. Hence it was not
unusual for him to call on Mrs. Mulvy to
give her a list of poor to be visited and helped.
He was on such an errand now.</p>

<p>Father Boone's method of directing a club
found no place for carrying information to
parents. He preferred to settle matters with
the boys themselves, and in a manner that
would be helpful to them, and that would
leave no sting. In his mind, it would be an
acknowledgment of defeat if he had to carry a
case into the home. He had never done it yet.</p>

<p>After his instant of hesitation, and convinced
that he knew the subject of conversation,
Frank assumed an indifferent air and
stepped forward to greet the priest. Father
Boone continued to talk. Frank waited a
moment, bewildered, and then said, "Good
afternoon, Father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good afternoon, <i>sir</i>," was the response.</p>

<p>Frank stiffened, every muscle of his body
became like steel. He could not look at his
mother. If he did, he might break down and he
did not want to give the director that satisfaction.
So he stood facing the priest.</p>

<p>All three were embarrassed. Mrs. Mulvy
knew the significance of that <i>sir</i>. Frank, sure
now of his suspicions, made a desperate plunge.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Father, that you felt obliged
to carry this matter to my mother, but I
suppose you know best."</p>

<p>Father Boone literally gasped. For a moment
he looked at Mrs. Mulvy, then he turned
back to Frank. Realizing that the matter had
come to an issue, and without his doing, he
said, in a deliberate, penetrating tone,</p>

<p>"Frank Mulvy, do you, or do you not,
know anything about that shameful destruction
at the Club?" Already Frank saw his
folly. He was in just the corner he had foreseen.
Acknowledgment would mean the
betrayal of a sacred confidence. Every moment
of silence was agony to his mother.
Denial he could not make, for he had never
in his whole life made a conscious mis-statement.
Silence was fatal. Denial was impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Acknowledgment was betrayal of Bill's
confidence. What could he do?</p>

<p>Again the priest said slowly and solemnly:
"Do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
about that act of destruction?"</p>

<p>"Speak up, Frank," his mother said, imploringly.</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice and the look of
that face, he collapsed. His pent up emotions of
the past days burst out in sobs, his body shook
convulsively. Both priest and mother tried to
soothe him. That only made it worse. Father
Boone turned away and stood at the window,
looking out. Then with only a quiet and
casual good-bye, he took up his hat and left.</p>

<p>Hardly had the door closed behind him
when Frank threw his arms about his mother,
and burst into renewed sobs. Mrs. Mulvy
was puzzled and distressed but she had full
faith in her boy. She let him have his cry
out, and then said gently: "Don't mind,
dear, you are mother's best boy; she knows
this will come out all right."</p>

<p>"O mother, if you feel that way, and will
trust me, without asking me a single question,
I promise you it will come out more than all
right."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, darling," she replied, "I'll say
nothing again on the matter except you yourself
bring it up."</p>

<p>"O, I'm so glad, mother, because now I
can see it through. I don't mind what others
say or think as long as it is all right with you."</p>

<p>"But I feel so sorry for Father Boone," she
sighed. "He is apparently all at sea. He
thinks the world of you, Frank, and that is
what hurts him."</p>

<p>"I know, mother, and that is what hurts
me, too, but there is no help for it at present.
He's got to get all the facts first&mdash;and I
can't&mdash;" He broke off and then added, shyly,
"You know, mother, I think we are a good
deal the same. Only, of course, his will is so
strong, he won't show what he feels. The
other day there were tears in his eyes, but he
didn't know I was seeing him."</p>

<p>"Mother is proud of her boy to hear him
talk that way. I'm so glad that you're not
angry with poor Father Boone&mdash;it is hard on
him."</p>

<p>"Maybe I would be, mother, if I did not
know him so well."</p>

<p>A great load was off Frank's mind and the
tension was gone. Nothing could matter now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
He could face anything and everything. He
realized that, at most, only a few days would
intervene before Bill Daly would clear up the
mystery.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(V)</div>

<p>When Father Boone left Mrs. Mulvy and
Frank, he had indeed troublesome thoughts
for companion. The conviction that Frank
knew a good deal about the matter was now
absolutely sure. Evidently, also, the boy was
in some way implicated in a conspiracy of
silence. His whole appearance showed that
he was holding back something and that he
was doing so reluctantly. His complete collapse
indicated a great interior struggle. It
also showed that the boy was naturally high-minded
and noble. For otherwise, he never
would have broken down, as he did.</p>

<p>But what was holding him back? Why
should he fear to trust the director? He found
no answer to free him from his quandary.
He would gladly settle the whole matter, and
regard the affair closed, if he considered
only his own feelings. But his duty to the
boys must not be shirked because it caused
present pain to himself or others. "Better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to have a tooth pulled," he said, "than to
have it the source of future trouble."</p>

<p>When Father Boone entered his room, he
found several letters on his desk. They were
mostly Church matters. But one was different.
It was on better quality of stationery
than the ordinary. The envelope and the
paper bore a monogram. Opening it, he found
these lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Father Boone:</p>

<p>I want to thank you for all your kindness
to John. Enclosed is a little contribution
for the Club. Hereafter, it will
be impossible for John to attend the Club
meetings, and so I request you to drop
his name from membership.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">Julia Harkins.</span><br />
(Mrs. John Harkins.)<br />
</div>

<p>To Rev. Jerome Boone, S. J.</p></div>

<p>John Harkins resigned from the Club!...
Anyone who knew Father Boone's ideas about
the Club would have understood at once what
this resignation meant to him. Mrs. Harkins'
letter didn't explain why it was "impossible
for John to attend the Club" but it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
clearly written between the lines. John
Harkins was a boy enjoying exceptional home
advantages and his refinement, manliness and
social standards made him just the type to
give "tone" to the Club.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harkins was rightly very careful of the
associations her son formed, and Father Boone
had been her guarantee that in the Club
John would mingle with perhaps poor, but
good and manly boys. Evidently rumors of
the affair had reached her.</p>

<p>"The Club is discredited! The director has
been asleep. Cockle in the field. And here
I am sitting and allowing the weeds to grow
and the wheat to be choked. I will get to the
bottom of this at once. With the Club's name
in question, I am certainly justified in drastic
action&mdash;in probing the matter directly. I will
send for Mulvy right away. I should have
done it long ago."</p>

<p>In answer to his summons, Frank was on
hand a half hour ahead of time that evening,
but not ahead of Father Boone. He went
straight to the director's office and found him
engaged at his desk.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Frank," the priest began, as he
stopped work. "I am going to get right down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to business. I am speaking to you as an official
of the Club. The Club is being discredited.
The parish is filled with reports and rumors.
I am being discredited. Look at that letter.
Things have gone too far. Heretofore, I have
not asked you any questions on this matter
because your duty was plain. I wanted you
to perform it like a man, unsolicited. You
have not done it, I regret to say, and now I
must question you like the others. The welfare
of the Club is at stake, and its fitness
for carrying on its work, imperiled. Decent
parents won't want their boys to belong. It
is abroad in the parish that rowdyism is
rampant here. I want to nail the nasty rumor,
and place it where it belongs. There is an
explanation, and I want you to help me get it.
Frank Mulvy, did you have a hand in the
wreckage wrought in the Club the other night?
Answer me <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>."</p>

<p>"No, Father."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot answer, Father."</p>

<p>"You cannot answer! You cannot answer!
Do you mean to say that you refuse to do your
duty? Cannot! What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>In an agitated voice, Frank replied, "Father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
I cannot say any more, except to add that
I am doing what you yourself have always
inculcated."</p>

<p>"Neglect of duty! Explain yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"Not neglect of duty, Father, but regard
for honor. You have always held that up to
us, along with our religion, and it is honor
now that makes me decline to say more. I
will answer any questions about myself or
anything that I can answer by official knowledge,
and take the consequences. More I
cannot say."</p>

<p>"And more I do not want you to do, Frank.
But tell me, why did you not at least inform
me of the wreckage; that was official?"</p>

<p>"Father, I did not know of that until recently."</p>

<p>"What, do you mean to say that all that
terrible row occurred, and that it's out all over
the parish, and you, the chief official of the
Club at the time, did not know of it?"</p>

<p>"Father," declared Frank, in trembling
tones, "I know it all looks bad, all the appearances
are against me, I have only my word
and character to stand by me."</p>

<p>"It is your character that has stood by you
till now, sir. Were you not Mulvy, I had acted
differently. But it is because you are Mulvy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that I have trusted, until the Club and its
director are discredited. But what's the matter,
boy?"</p>

<p>For of a sudden, Frank had turned white.
He swayed a moment, but Father Boone
caught him in his arms, laid him gently on
the floor. It took but a dash of cold water to
fully restore him, and for a moment he just
stared into the face of the priest. Then
Father Boone noticed how his color rushed
back and his jaws set and he realized that the
boy was suffering keen mental anguish. It
came to him that there was something most
unusual and extraordinary about the whole
thing.</p>

<p>After a bit Frank said in a voice choked with
emotion, "I know you have suffered, Father,
and that has hurt me." He could say no more
but after a little, he began again. "At first,
I did not know anything about the matter,
and when I did know, I could not speak. I
wish I could clear the matter up, but I cannot
do so honorably, and I know you don't want
me to do it dishonorably."</p>

<p>The priest patted him on the back and told
him to do what was right and not to think of
consequences. "And as you consider silence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the right thing now, I do not wish you to do
otherwise than as you are doing."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Father," replied Frank. "But
please&mdash;I am true to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered the priest, "but
it's all a mystery, nevertheless, and it must
be solved, and," he added vigorously, "it
shall be solved."</p>

<p>Frank went below. The priest closed the
door, and fell into a brown study. "What am
I to do?" he reflected. "This thing must be
nailed. But how?"</p>

<p>He was not looking for boys to punish, but
for the solution of the problem, and the clearing
of the good name of the Club. Taking out
a large sheet of paper, he wrote in big letters
for the notice board in the library reading
room:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>"Boys of St. Leonard's Club:</div>

<p>This is an appeal to the boys who have
the good name of the Club, and their own
at heart. I want no boy to tell on another.
But I do request that the perpetrators
of that act of wanton destruction
declare themselves to me at once. You
know my ways, and that I am the first to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
make every allowance and to see fair play.
I await in the office a response to this
notice this very night.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Jerome Boone."<br />
</div></div>

<p>The first boy to read the notice was Ned
Mullen. "Whew!" he exclaimed, with a long
whistle. He ran into the games-room, "Hey,
fellows, see what's up&mdash;some notice&mdash;riot act!"</p>

<p>At first they paid no attention to him,
saying merely, "Quit your guying, kid."</p>

<p>But as he shouted out, "Frank, Tom, Dick,
come see the board, a real live circus is in
town," they all dropped their games, and
trooped into the reading room.</p>

<p>"Gee!" was the exclamation from every
throat.</p>

<p>"That's news."</p>

<p>"What row is that?"</p>

<p>"Wanton destruction!"</p>

<p>"That sounds good."</p>

<p>"O, but say, it's the real thing."</p>

<p>"That's Father Boone's handwriting. What
does it mean?"</p>

<p>Then they fell to asking questions all together.</p>

<p>Finally, it settled down to what had happened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and when it happened, and how it
happened. Everybody asked everybody else
what it was all about, and everybody told
everybody he did not know. Some boys got
around Frank and began to quiz him.</p>

<p>"Did you see any damage done, Mulvy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Let's form a committee and send our
regrets to Father Boone, and also say there
must be a mistake."</p>

<p>They all agreed.</p>

<p>"Name Mulvy spokesman of the committee,"
shouted McHugh.</p>

<p>Frank protested, but they paid no attention
to him. Soon the committee was formed, and
was ready to go upstairs. They waited for
Frank. As he did not move they said, "Step
along, Mulvy, we are all ready."</p>

<p>"I said no. Count me out."</p>

<p>"Count you out, nothing," yelled several.
"You're elected, now go."</p>

<p>Frank did not move. Sunney Galvin, one
of the biggest boys in the Club, and a good
fellow, walked up to him and said, "No nonsense,
Frank, face the music; you owe it to
Father Boone and the Club to help set matters
right."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sunney, I said no, and that settles it."</p>

<p>"It settles nothing," said Sunney. "Unless
you are in the scrape yourself, you'll go like
a man and do your part. You have been
chosen."</p>

<p>"Chosen or not, I don't go. That's final,"
he said with vigor.</p>

<p>"O ho, Mulvy, so there's somebody involved
after all! You wouldn't play safe if
you were not concerned."</p>

<p>"See here, Galvin," said Frank, "you know
me well enough to know that I am square.
Give a fellow credit for knowing his own
business."</p>

<p>"O that's very well, and all that, Mulvy.
But your business here and now is to do the
duty you've been elected to. And if you
don't, you're yellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, and something worse," cried another.</p>

<p>"Do you know too much for your own
reputation?" shouted another. For although
Frank was the best liked and most admired
boy in the Club, boys are boys, and they talk
right out. Frank knew they had a certain
amount of right on their side and that was
what helped him to swallow the insults, which
otherwise he would have resented vigorously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd was rather amazed itself that he
did not resent their insinuations more than
he did. Gradually the word passed that he
was in the thing himself, and did not dare face
Father Boone. Dick resented that intensely.</p>

<p>"He is not, and you all know it."</p>

<p>"Hank, old man," he said, "clear yourself,
come along with us."</p>

<p>"I can't, Dick."</p>

<p>"O nonsense," replied Dick, "you've got
some honor bug in your bonnet and you're
making a fool of yourself. Come along now,
and give the crowd a solar plexus."</p>

<p>"Dick, please don't urge. I tell you I can't go."</p>

<p>The crowd stood around, listening to the
dialogue, giving Dick every encouragement
and signalling to Frank to give in. When the
fellows saw his stubborn stand, they resented
it. It was not fair. It looked compromising.</p>

<p>While they stood, thus-minded, Dick said
rather timidly, "May I ask you a question,
Hank?" There were only a few boys in the
Club who could call Frank by that name.
Dick was one of them.</p>

<p>"Certainly, kid, fire away."</p>

<p>"Did you have anything to do with this
racket?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I knew it," said Dick. "That's why I
asked you. Now another question. Do you
know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"That's another matter," said Frank.</p>

<p>"We know it's another matter," shouted
several, "and we've got a right to know. It
concerns the bunch."</p>

<p>"The bunch doesn't make wrong right,"
fairly yelled Frank. "The bunch doesn't
make a mean thing honorable. Yes, I know
about it, and that's why I can't go. I can't
say more because I have said all I can say,
in honor."</p>

<p>"Honor!" hissed one of the boys, "it's
queer honor that will distress Father Boone
and queer a whole crowd."</p>

<p>By this time the racket had grown into a
half riot. The voices were loud and raucous.
Their echoes reached Father Boone above.
He closed his door as he did not want to
hear what was not intended for his ears. But
he had caught enough to let him know that
there was a deepening mystery about the
affair, and that most of the boys were not a
party to it.</p>

<p>Things were gradually shaping for a fight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
It was clear that Frank had taken a firm
stand. It was equally clear that the crowd
was not satisfied or in sympathy with it.</p>

<p>Some of the larger boys did not relish his
excusing himself on the ground of honor.
Fred Gibney bawled out, "You're prating a lot
about honor, Mulvy. What about the Club's
honor?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Gibney," snapped Frank, "I
have the Club's honor as much at heart as
any of you, and you know it. But just now&mdash;"
his voice quivered, "I know how you regard
the matter. I suppose I'd feel the same if I
were in your place. All I can say is that I
know what I know in confidence, and I'm in
honor bound. Will that satisfy you? I have
said more than I intended to, but it's because
I want to go the limit to satisfy the crowd on
my stand."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a book speech," retorted
Gibney, "and it's all very well for you to hide
behind honor. Any of us could get out of a
bad hole that way."</p>

<p>"That means that you think I am lying?"
questioned Frank, his eyes fairly aglow.</p>

<p>"It means what you want to make of it,"
snapped Gibney.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank jumped from his place to get at
Gibney. Dick got in between the two, but
found it more than he could do to restrain
Frank. As blows were on the point of being
exchanged, steps were heard on the stairs,
and the boys signalled that Father Boone
was on the way down. At his approach, the
boys assumed a more or less quiet posture.
Not so Frank. He stood just where he was and
as he was. His fists were clenched, his whole
frame was trembling with excitement, and his
face was determined and pale.</p>

<p>Father Boone took in the situation at a
glance. He appeared, however, not to see the
impending fight. Beckoning to Ned, he said,
"I want you and four or five boys to help me
unpack something upstairs." He knew that
this interruption would give all a breathing
spell, and stop further animosity. Then like
a flash, it occurred to him to settle the whole
thing then and there.</p>

<p>"Boys," said he, "your shouts and some of
your talk have reached me upstairs. I am
very much hurt over this affair, and I know,
from what has happened, that most of you
feel as I do. I caught some of the words between
Gibney and Mulvy. They reveal a lot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to me. First of all, apparently, what has happened
was not the work of the crowd, but of
a few only and you are as much mystified as
I am. I am glad to know that the Club as a
whole is not implicated. But a bad report has
gone through the parish in regard to that
occurrence, and I am bound, in duty to the
parish and in devotion to you, to clear up
the matter.</p>

<p>"And so I say now to you all, what I have
already said by that notice, I ask the boys who
perpetrated that rowdyism or who know anything
about it, to stand out and declare themselves!"</p>

<p>Not a boy moved. After a moment's
silence, Frank came forward and stood before
the priest. "Well, Frank, have you anything
to say?"</p>

<p>"Only what I said to you upstairs, Father."</p>

<p>"Do you still feel in conscience that you
can say no more?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the priest. After a
pause he continued, "I do not want any boy
to act dishonorably. But there are certain
cases where justice is concerned, where the
rights of many are in conflict with those of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
few, where scandal is involved, where the
instrument for doing substantial good is in
danger of being destroyed; under such circumstances
it is not only not dishonorable to
speak out, but it is highly honorable to do so.
I know a boy's code of honor, and how he
regards a 'squealer.' But it is not squealing
to denounce a criminal. And in this case
nothing short of a crime has been committed.
Wilful damage has been done to property,
and consequent damage has been done to
reputation. If you saw a boy break into your
home, and destroy valuable things, you would
not consider it squealing to denounce him to
the authorities. That very thing has occurred
here. And you are in duty bound to stop sin
or crime if it is in your power to do so.</p>

<p>"If you know those who are guilty in this
matter, it is your duty to see to it that they
declare themselves, in order that the good
name of the Club may not suffer further, and
that the damage done to property may be
made good.</p>

<p>"With this explanation, I again ask those
concerned to declare themselves." Not a boy
moved.</p>

<p>"Frank Mulvy, after what I have said, do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
you still find you are not justified in speaking
out?"</p>

<p>"I do, Father."</p>

<p>"I respect your conscience, Frank, but I am
hard put to find a justification for it. If you
were a lawyer or a doctor or a priest, and had
got your information in your capacity of
adviser, I could see your point of view. But
you are a boy of fourteen, and hardly of the
age that invites confidence. If I did not know
you as well as I do, I should consider you a
party to the affair. As it is, you seem to be
the only boy who knows anything about the
matter, or&mdash;the only one who has the courage
to say so."</p>

<p>Here Dick spoke up. "Father, the whole
thing has us puzzled. We do not know yet just
what you refer to. You speak of damage and
rowdyism. We have not seen any. It was only
by report that we heard about it and we've
got into lots of trouble denying and resenting
it. Until your notice was put up today, we
treated the entire matter as a calumny. The
only row we know of was that scrap between
Frank and Bill Daly. That was nothing.
Frank himself went up to tell you about that.
We were all at sea when we saw you so indignant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
We formed a committee to wait on you.
As things are it looks bad for Frank. But we
all know him and I&mdash;I&mdash;want to go on record
now as standing by him, if he says he can't
tell, in honor."</p>

<p>Frank seized his hand. "Dick, you're true
blue."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Richard," said Father
Boone slowly, and then, taking Frank by the
hand, he added, "Frank, I trust you absolutely."</p>

<p>"Then I am ready for anything, Father."</p>

<p>Gibney now came up rather sheepishly,
saying "Mulvy, I hope you'll pardon me."</p>

<p>"Nothing to pardon, old man, you did what
any fellow would do," answered Frank. Then
he swung around to the crowd quickly. "Fellows,
I feel I'm 'in bad.' Everything is against
me as things go ordinarily. You have nothing
but my word for my defence. I hardly deserve
such trust. But I hope you won't regret it."</p>

<p>"Frank, take that notice off the bulletin
board and put it on my desk upstairs." As
Frank left the room, Father Boone turned to
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Boys, a good character is the best thing
in life. Frank Mulvy's character alone stands
between him and your condemnation. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
this matter has no other issue than the present,
it is worth while. I could talk on uprightness
a month, and it would not impress
you as much as what has happened before us."</p>

<p>At this point Frank returned and Tommy
spoke up: "Will you tell us, Father, what it is
that you are so much worked up over? We
don't know what has happened, you know,
about breakage and wanton destruction."</p>

<p>"I hope," said the priest, "that every boy
here is as you are, Tommy, wholly ignorant
of the matter. That only adds to the mystery,
for you may as well expect a man to walk
without legs as to have a lot of things broken
and smashed without arms. Whose were the
arms, if not yours of the Club, I'd like to
know? I shall describe to you what occurred,
and leave the mystery to you."</p>

<p>Then in a few words he told them how he
had come to the Club a few mornings ago,
and found it all upset, chairs broken, tables
overturned, pictures torn down, ink spilled
on the floor, and the rest of it. As the narration
went on, the eyes of the boys got as big as
saucers. If looks and gestures were significant,
they told of surprise, disgust, condemnation.
As he finished, Dick spoke:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, that solves one mystery. We could
not understand why you withdrew the McCormack
treat, and took on so dreadfully. We
know, now, and I for one want to beg your
pardon for any feeling I had against you."</p>

<p>"Me, too!", "Me, too!", came from different
parts of the room.</p>

<p>"That is one cloud rolled away, boys," said
the priest. "May it be an augury that the
others and bigger ones will vanish also. We
are like travelers in the desert who often see
things where they do not exist. Weary and
exhausted caravans frequently have visions
of trees and springs which lure them on, only
to see them vanish in thin air. Scientists call
it a <i>mirage</i>. Life, too, has its mirages."</p>

<p>"How strange," said Frank to himself, as
they were leaving the room, "Bill and I used
the same expression when we were talking
together at the hospital."</p>

<p>The boys went home a pensive lot. But
everyone of them was determined to solve
the mystery.</p>

<h2>Chapter V</h2>

<h3>The Holy Grail</h3>


<p>By this time the whole parish knew about
the affair at the Club. Like all reports, it
increased in the telling until there was the
general impression that the Club was a pack
of rowdies. Many a father and mother wondered
why Father Boone tolerated such an
organization.</p>

<p>"I thought these boys were in good keeping,"
said one mother to another.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's worse than we know of,"
replied the other, "for I tried to get at the
facts from my Johnnie, but he was as close as
a clam. Unless it was something dreadful,
he wouldn't mind telling his mother."</p>

<p>The fact was that the boys had reached an
understanding not to talk about the affair
at all. They were determined to clear the
Club's name and until they had something
definite to offer, explanations, they decided,
had best be omitted. So 'mum' was the word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvy was returning from early Mass,
that morning, when Mrs. Doyle, a woman she
highly regarded, stopped her to say that it
was too bad that Frank was mixed up in the
row at the Club. Mrs. Mulvy only smiled
and remarked that she thought there must be
some mistake. But a little later in the day,
Mrs. Duffy called on her and after a few
conventional remarks, said "I really think it
is too bad, Mrs. Mulvy, that those boys
should be up to such mischief."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you refer to, Mrs. Duffy?"</p>

<p>"I thought you knew all about it&mdash;that
wholesale smash-up at the Club. Surely it
was disgraceful. Furniture broken, the pictures
and walls disfigured and the whole house
ransacked. It's a wonder some of them were
not arrested."</p>

<p>This was news to Mrs. Mulvy. She had
heard Father Boone call the doings at the
Club serious, but she supposed that they were
only serious in his eyes, because of the high
standard he had set for the boys. Now she
heard for the first time of wholesale damage,
of wrecked rooms and furniture! "Are you
sure of all this?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duffy replied, "It must be so, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
everybody is talking about it." Then she
added, "But my boy, George, won't open his
mouth about it. It must be bad if he is afraid
to let me know. I am going to take him to the
priest tonight and find out all about it, and if
he had a hand in it&mdash;well, he'll wish he hadn't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvy was too confused to speak.
She had wondered why Father Boone was so
stern when he addressed Frank as "sir."
Also she had wondered at Frank's intense
emotion on that occasion. "So it was really
serious," she reflected. "And gossip is getting
Frank all mixed up with it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Duffy continued hesitatingly, "I
thought I'd come over to see you first, Mrs.
Mulvy, because they all say that Frank is the
only one who owned up to knowing anything
about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvy caught her breath. However,
she answered, composedly enough, "I should
be sorry to know that my boy was really in
such awful mischief, but if he was, I am
proud that he owned up to it. It is boy-like
to get into a scrape, but it is very noble to
stand up and admit it."</p>

<p>"I feel that way myself, Mrs. Mulvy. If
George was in it, he will have to own up to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but I am sorry that he did not do so of his
own accord. George is a good boy, though,
I never knew him to do anything that I was
ashamed of before," said Mrs. Duffy wistfully,
as she took her leave. Mrs. Mulvy
almost collapsed as she sank into a chair.</p>

<p>For a few moments she was in a state of
distraction. At length she sighed, "Poor
Frank!" After a while, she arose and went
to a little shrine of the Blessed Virgin which
she called her oratory. Here it was that the
whole family knelt every night to say the
rosary together. Here it was that each one
said morning prayers before leaving the house
for the day's occupations. She had consecrated
all her children to the Blessed Mother,
and begged her powerful protection for them.
The Mother of God had been a good Mother
to her devoted children, and so far Mrs.
Mulvy had realized that devotion to Christ's
Mother was one of the greatest safeguards of
virtue. She knelt before the image of the
Blessed Mother and prayed, "Mother of God,
to whose care I have entrusted the little ones
He has given me, be more than ever a Mother
to my children now. Especially take under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thy protection my good boy Frank. Holy
Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now, and at the hour of our death. Amen."</p>

<p>When she arose she had decided to make no
inquiries of Father Boone, nor would she have
any misgivings about her boy. She would
trust him.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>On his way to school the same morning,
Frank was stopped a number of times and
asked, "What was that scrape you got into,
Mulvy?" At first, he laughed it off. But
gradually it irritated him, as one after another
referred to it. It was his custom to make a visit
to the church every morning on his way to
school. This morning he went straight to the
altar of the Blessed Virgin and prayed fervently
that in this trying situation he would
do nothing displeasing to her or her Son.
He also begged her that she would be a Mother
to his mother and help her in this hour of
trial. Arising from prayer he felt that he
could submit to misunderstanding or even
injustice, and do it patiently.</p>

<p>On leaving the church he met Tommy and
Dick also coming out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed Dick, "you are in for it,
Hank. Everybody says that you are the cause
of the Club damage. The fellows are saying
nothing, but one or two must have leaked,
for it's all over the parish that you admitted
you were in it."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Tommy, "I nearly got into a
fight denying that you had a part in the
matter."</p>

<p>"You two are true blue," answered Frank.
"Things do look bad for me. But in a day or
two it'll be all cleared up." He was calculating
on Bill Daly's telling everything to Father
Boone on his next visit to the hospital.
Frank knew that the priest would see Bill
every day or so until he got well, and that it
was only a rush of work that had kept the
director from going down again before this.</p>

<p>When Frank got to school he noticed almost
at once that Mr. Collins seemed somewhat
disturbed. He barely bade Frank good morning.
When a teacher prides himself on the
fact that his class bears the highest reputation
in the school for deportment and application,
of course he feels it keenly if one of
his best boys is the subject of criticism and
veiled accusations. On the way to school,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Mr. Collins had got many inquiries about
Mulvy's character. 'He was glad to say that
Frank was the finest boy in his class.' But by
the time he reached the class room, he showed
his disturbed feelings in his greeting to Frank.
The boy really cared greatly for his teacher,
and was hurt to think that he should lose
his good opinion even for a short while.</p>

<p>However, class went on as usual until about
ten o'clock, when the principal of the school
entered the class room. He listened to the
recitations for a short while and spoke approvingly
of the good work being done. Then
he turned to Mr. Collins and said, "Have you
any of Father Boone's boys in your class?"</p>

<p>"I believe I have. Will the boys who belong
to Father Boone's Club please stand."</p>

<p>Four stood up.</p>

<p>"That will do," said the principal. "Be
seated. I should like you four boys to report
at the office at noon."</p>

<p>At recess, the four got together and conjectured
what was up. "O, it's clear," said
Frank. "He wants to find out if any of the
High School boys are implicated."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he'll do?" remarked
Redmond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he'll quiz us, of course. He may
have heard exaggerated reports of the thing."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it is any of his business,"
observed Cavanaugh.</p>

<p>"Well, you know," responded Frank, "that
the Regal is mighty touchy about its reputation
and he does not want any mud slung at
it if he can help it."</p>

<p>At noon the four went together to the office.
The principal met them and began at once.</p>

<p>"Boys, it's really not my affair, but I can't
help being concerned. You know our school
puts a value not only on learning, but on
character. I should say, mainly on character.
I hate to hear of any of our boys being mixed
up in an ungentlemanly affair. I have called
you in order to get the truth of the matter.
There are bad rumors afloat. I don't trust
them. Mulvy, may I ask you to state just
what occurred?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather you'd ask Redmond, Father,
if you please."</p>

<p>"It's all the same. I asked you, Mulvy,
because they tell me you are secretary of the
Club, and Mr. Collins informs me you are the
leader of his class."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Father, but I have personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
reasons for declining to speak of the affair."</p>

<p>"Very well, my boy, I don't wish to embarrass
you. Tell me, Redmond, just what
happened."</p>

<p>Redmond narrated everything.</p>

<p>"That sounds very serious," declared the
principal. "Father Boone is a good friend
of mine, and very devoted to you boys. He
undoubtedly feels this thing more than you
can imagine."</p>

<p>"We know that, and really, that's what
hurts us most," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Now, young men, I am going to ask you
a question. You are not obliged to answer it
unless you wish. It is outside my domain.
Did any of you have a hand in that affair?"</p>

<p>The four answered together, "No."</p>

<p>"Good, I knew it. Now I can state that
the High School boys were not in the mischief
at all. Now another question. Do you know
who did it?"</p>

<p>Three answered, "No."</p>

<p>The principal noticed Frank's silence, and
turning to the boys, he dismissed them, at
the same time asking Frank to stay a moment.</p>

<p>"My boy," he began, "you indicate that
you have some knowledge of this affair. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
also show that you're concerned about Father
Boone's feelings in the matter. I wish you to
know that he is terribly cut up over this thing.
You are, or were, an official of the Club. If,
without actual dishonor, you can give him any
clue to the perpetrators, you should do it,
for it concerns justice and charity."</p>

<p>"I have considered that, Father, and I am
persuaded that I must not say what I know."</p>

<p>"Well," said the principal, "I'll take your
word for that. I know you better than you
think. If you feel that way, I would not insist
a particle. But bear in mind, young man, the
only thing that stands between you and condemnation
is yourself. With those who know
you that is sufficient. With others, you may
have to suffer for the stand you are taking."</p>

<p>"I'm suffering now, and expect to suffer
more. But I know I'm right, and that's the
main thing."</p>

<p>"I am proud of you, Mulvy," said the principal,
as he dismissed him.</p>

<p>Outside the school it was rumored that
Frank had been ordered to the principal's
office and had been threatened with suspension.
Color was given this report by the fact
that he came out from the school alone and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
much later than the rest, looking decidedly
uncomfortable. The words of assurance given
him by the principal had affected him deeply.</p>

<p>Of course the report was that he had got a
dreadful laying out from the principal. There
were not a few boys of the school who were
glad to hear of Frank's downfall. He had
been so much respected by teachers, and so
well liked by his companions, that there were
bound to be some fellows rather envious of him.</p>

<p>As he passed the first corner of the street,
he encountered a group of some eight or ten
boys standing around. One of the largest
boys, John Morris, remarked, for Frank's
benefit, "I say, fellows, lots of statues are
toppling these days." For a moment Frank's
blood boiled, and he was on the point of resenting
the slur, when he recollected that
after all, appearances were against him and he
must take the consequences of his attitude.
So he came up smiling. Most of the boys were
of the class a year ahead of him, but Frank
had always been welcomed in the older groups.</p>

<p>When Morris perceived, or fancied, that his
shot had missed the mark, he said calmly,
"I see you got a 'call-down,' Mulvy."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank, "and a hard one, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>At this, most of the fellows sympathized
with him. Boys have, for the most part, a
sense of justice. They desire to see fair play&mdash;they
know when to let up. When he reached
home, he went straight to his mother.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "you won't listen to
any of the stories and things they are saying,
will you? I could speak of it&mdash;of that whole
Club matter, you know, to the priest, in confession,
mother, but to no one else and in no
other way. If some one had told you, mother,
in the most sacred confidence, something
about his most secret doings, and if it was
something which you never could know otherwise,
would you feel justified in revealing it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Frank."</p>

<p>"Well, that is my position, mother. For
the present my mouth is locked, but in due
time everything will be set right."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my boy. Mother knows you will
do what is right. Duty costs dear, but one
must pay the price. After all, if it were easy
to do right, there wouldn't be much credit
in it. It is the hard things that count."</p>

<p>"I am glad, mother, that we both look at it
in the same way."</p>

<p>Her answer was a kiss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />(III)</div>

<p>On his way to the Club that evening, Frank
met Dick.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the news, Hank?" he said.
"Bill Daly is dying. He has typhoid."</p>

<p>"Who told you, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Tom Gaffney. He was down to the rectory
before supper and Father Boone had just
come back from the hospital. He told him that
Bill was delirious three days. He also said
that he had given him the last rites, and that
there was slim chance for his recovery."</p>

<p>Frank and Dick accelerated their pace.
They were both anxious to hear more about
the matter. At the Club, they met Father
Boone going out.</p>

<p>"Boys, say a little prayer for William Daly.
I think he is near the end."</p>

<p>"Was he prepared?" asked Frank, a lump
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Everything except confession," replied the
priest. "You see, he is delirious. I have been
down to see him twice a day the last two
days, but he has not regained consciousness.
I am going down now in hopes I may find
him able to go to confession. If not, we must
leave him to God and the Blessed Mother."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Saying that, he started off to the hospital.</p>

<p>Frank turned white as a sheet.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Hank?" said Dick.
He could not answer. "Why, what's up,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"O, nothing, Dick, I'm all right now."</p>

<p>Like a flash it had occurred to Frank.
"What if Daly should die without saying anything
about the Club affair!" No wonder his
heart beat like a hammer! No wonder Dick
showed alarm.</p>

<p>"I've been intending to go down and see
Daly," said Frank, "but it has been one thing
after another these past two days. Besides,
I left him all right. Yes, I hope he comes out
of it."</p>

<p>When the two friends entered the Club
they found the crowd pretty serious. The
exploit which had landed Daly in the hospital
had endeared him to the fellows, and they
now felt genuinely sorry for him. They began
to recall their mean treatment of him on the
very night of the fire. They asked one another
what it was he had wanted to say, when they
gave him no chance to open his mouth.
Everything occurred to them except the one
thing, the damage at the Club. Somehow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that never seemed to connect itself with Daly.</p>

<p>As they sat around more or less in silence,
Frank said, "Tomorrow is the First Friday;
what do you say, fellows, if we go to Communion
for Bill?" Every boy assented.</p>

<p>When, about an hour later, Father Boone
returned, he was very serious.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, "Daly is in a critical condition.
The doctors hold out little hope.
Tomorrow I shall say Mass for him. I hope
you boys will also remember him in your
prayers."</p>

<p>"We are all going to Communion for him
tomorrow, Father," said Ned.</p>

<p>"O, that's good," answered the priest.
"That's very good of you. God knows what is
best. His holy Will be done, but we shall pray
that if it is God's Will, he may be spared."</p>

<p>"Was he conscious?" anxiously asked
Frank.</p>

<p>"No," answered the priest, "I have been
watching him carefully the past two days,
but so far he has not got out of his delirium."
Frank had a return, suddenly, of that faint
feeling. True, the Club damage was in the
background now, in the presence of death,
but it was only deferred, not settled. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
what would happen if the secret died with
Daly?</p>

<p>Frank was extremely conscientious. He
was not counting on what he could lawfully
do in case Daly should die. He was determined
that if worse came to worst he would
bear the brunt of the disgrace himself rather
than say a word that would blacken the name
of one who had passed away. He must not
flinch. He must be a real Knight of the Cross.</p>

<p>Frank left the Club much earlier than usual
and alone. Something seemed to draw him to
the hospital. At any rate, after five minutes,
he found himself on the avenue going down
to where Bill Daly lay in delirium. He got
permission at the office to visit him. When he
reached the patient, he found Mr. and Mrs.
Daly there. Mrs. Daly welcomed him and
introduced him to Mr. Daly as "that nice
boy I told you about."</p>

<p>"And you are Willie's friend?" said Mr. Daly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad to say."</p>

<p>"O, he was the good boy," continued Bill's
father. "He should have had a better chance!"</p>

<p>Frank said nothing.</p>

<p>Then the mother began, "Willie was all I
had to live for these many years, and now that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
his father's himself again, maybe God will
take away my boy. Oh, but it's a cruel world
and hard to understand! But God knows
best."</p>

<p>"We are all going to Communion for him
tomorrow," said Frank, sympathetically.
"When Father Boone told us that William
was dangerously ill, all the boys of the Club
agreed to go to Holy Communion for him.
You know tomorrow's the First Friday."</p>

<p>"O, thank you, you are such good boys,"
she sighed.</p>

<p>Frank did not know whether to stay or go.
Bill lay there unconscious, muttering from
time to time. His father and mother sat by
the bed on either side. Frank was standing.
They were in a private room. Bill had been
moved from the ward after a visit from Mr.
Roberts. Every comfort that good nursing
and attention could give was supplied. An
automobile, moreover, took Bill's parents to
and from the hospital. Mr. Roberts had told
Mrs. Daly that as soon as her boy got well
he would put him to school and see him
through to any profession he chose, and that
he would place Mr. Daly in a good position.</p>

<p>Mrs. Daly told all this to Frank as he stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
looking down into the patient's fevered face.
"But now I suppose it's all over with Willie,"
she groaned, "God's ways are not our ways.
His holy will be done! I told Mr. Roberts
about you, and how good you were to Willie
and me. He said he wants to see you. He will
be down soon, so you must wait till he comes."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to," replied Frank.</p>

<p>Bill was tossing about a good deal and now
he began a string of incoherent words. His
father and mother bent over him to see if they
could help him in any way. But he was only
rambling. After a little while, he began to
speak again. "Dad, you'll never drink again,
will you? Dad, you'll be good to Ma, won't
you?" Frank was about to retire when Mrs.
Daly beckoned to him to remain.</p>

<p>"Don't mind what he says, dear," she whispered.
"He talks that way all day." Then she
added, the tears filling her eyes, "and what
he says is so often the truth. But sometimes
he talks awful nonsense. Just before you came,
he was telling us about smashing tables and
furniture at the Club, poor boy!"</p>

<p>"And what he says is so often the truth,"
repeated Frank mentally.</p>

<p>Again Bill began to talk. "O, he has 'sand.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder what that means?" asked Mrs.
Daly.</p>

<p>Frank shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"But, he's good, too," continued Bill.
"That's why he has 'sand.' What a cur I was
to put him in bad." Then, after a pause,
"Mulvy, never again for me! Straight goods
for mine. No more yellow for Bill Daly."</p>

<p>His parents looked at one another. It was
all Greek to them. But it had much meaning
for Frank. Mr. Daly sat there in deep thought.
He was thinking of his early days, his happy
home, his fond child. And then came the
years after. The broken home, the broken
hearts and here now, his dying boy.</p>

<p>"God is punishing me," he thought to himself.
"But I wish He would not punish the
mother for my sins. O God, spare my boy!"</p>

<p>This last he said out loud. Frank and Mrs.
Daly turned suddenly toward him. His voice
was choked as he said, "O God, punish me
but spare those I love!" Frank's eyes filled
as he gazed on the broken man before him.</p>

<p>Again Bill's voice was heard. "Mother, I
want Frank. Send for Frank. I want Frank
and Father Boone. Dad, we'll never quarrel
again. Home will be nice for us all. Mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
mother, mother!" And he lapsed into unconsciousness
again.</p>

<p>Frank felt terribly out of place. Twice while
Bill was talking, he had started to go, but
Mrs. Daly held him. He seemed to be necessary
to her now. He was her boy's friend and
she wanted him by her. Frank perceived this
and he made up his mind to wait as long as
he could. After about an hour Father Boone
came in.</p>

<p>"I was down near here on a sick call, and I
thought I'd just drop in for a moment," he
said. "O, you here, Frank? Well now, that's
nice, I declare." And he sat down.</p>

<p>The doctor was making his final rounds for
the evening, and entered just as the priest
was seated. He saluted all, gave a special
nod to Father Boone, and then, after excusing
his interruption, went over to the patient.
All were quiet as he made his examination.
When he finished, the mother stood up and
looking him direct in the eyes, said, "Doctor,
is my boy going to die?"</p>

<p>"We never know, Madam. We can't tell.
We do all we can, and hope for the best.
That is what you must do too. But he is
very ill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>From the tone it was said in, the mother
gathered that there was little hope. That was
Father Boone's impression also. Mr. Daly
seemed to be in a trance. His mind was elsewhere.
But his taut face showed that he was
thinking regrettable things.</p>

<p>When the doctor left, Father Boone took
Mrs. Daly by the hand and said, "My dear
child, you must be brave. These are the moments
when our blessed Faith means everything
to us. God's will is the greatest thing
in the world. That is why our Lord, in teaching
us to pray, said: 'Thy will be done.'
He taught us that because it was necessary.
He taught it by example as well as by precept.
In Gethsemani He prayed, 'Not my will but
Thine be done.' He, the Son of God, had His
sorrows too. Resignation to God's will does
not mean that we must not feel or suffer, but
that in spite of our feelings, we rise up in
Faith and see God as our Father. We must
realize that He loves us, and we must say to
Him, 'Thy will be done.' His will may cause
pain now, but it is the pain that profits to life
everlasting, and the pain that makes us like
unto Him and dear to Him. Let us all kneel
down, all of us, and say the 'Our Father.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, solemnly, he prayed. "Our Father
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who art in heaven, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hallowed be
Thy name; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thy kingdom come; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<i>Thy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>
on earth as it is in heaven.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Give
us this day our daily bread. And forgive us
our trespasses, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as we forgive those
who trespass against us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And lead
us not into temptation; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but deliver us
from evil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Amen."</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;a long pause. Frank
thought it was a new prayer. He had never
realized all that it meant. It seemed the best
sermon he had ever heard. He felt now that
he could bow his head to anything that God
asked of him and say "Thy will be done."
The priest arose, and the others with him.</p>

<p>The mother's face was changed. There was
the peace of God on her countenance. In
the presence of her dying son, she had the
exaltation of Mary at the foot of the Cross.
Mr. Daly stood stunned. In a few minutes he
too showed a calm face. Father Boone was
the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"If God wants your boy, Mrs. Daly, let
Him have him. If you asked Willie for something
you would want him to give it to you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
If it was hard for him to give, you would know
he loved you when he gave it. If God asks you
for Willie, show Him you love Him. And now
good-bye.</p>

<p>"It is late, Frank. You had better come
along with me," he added, looking toward
him. They made their parting as consoling as
possible and left.</p>

<p>Later, as they struck the Avenue, and were
going along in silence, Father Boone began to
speak&mdash;half to himself, half to Frank. "I
suppose you wondered that I talked to them
as though Bill's death were a certainty? Well,
from my experience, I think it is. If I were
sure of being present when he dies, I would
not have anticipated. But suppose he goes
off tonight, and no one is there but themselves!
They have something now to sustain them.</p>

<p>"Our Faith is a wonderful thing. People outside
know nothing of the comfort and strength
it brings in affliction. There may be some
excuses for a fellow when he is young, and
healthy, and well-off, to say he has no use for
religion. But the whole world isn't young,
nor in health, nor rich. Most people have ills
of one kind or another. Some are poor, some
in ill-health, some old, or misunderstood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
So our Lord chose poverty and suffering. He
did not want better treatment than His followers
were to have.</p>

<p>"When anything hard happens to me, I try
to bear it cheerfully, and tell myself I should
be ashamed to have better treatment than My
Lord. And I've had some pretty tough things.
I don't show it, but your hair would stand
straight up if I were to tell you some of the
things I've gone through. And do you know,
when I have something terribly hard to
endure, I take a positive pleasure in kneeling
before the altar and saying to God: 'This
costs me a lot, Lord, but I am glad it does, for
I have something worth while to offer Thee'."
He heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Frank, excuse me for talking about myself.
Just thinking aloud. You see, that
afflicted mother and father bring out serious
reflections."</p>

<p>By now they had reached the rectory.
"Good bye, Frank," said the priest.</p>

<p>"Good bye, Father," answered Frank,
grasping the priest's hand very firmly.</p>

<p>As Frank went on his way, he said to himself,
"Gee, now I know where he gets his
power. When he prays, he prays. No wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
he does so much good, and so quietly. No
one knows anything about it unless by accident."</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IV)</div>

<p>At the hospital, Daly was sinking fast.
The doctor came in frequently. And then, as
often happens shortly before death, the delirium
terminated for awhile. Bill looked up
and saw his father and mother standing over
him. It took him some seconds to realize
where he was. It all came back to him in a
rush. He also felt very weak. He had never
felt like this before. Something told him he
was going to die.</p>

<p>In a low voice he said to his father, "Pop,
I guess I am wanted up there. I'm sorry for
all I've done. I know you'll be good to ma."
A pause. "Ma, it's hard to go and leave you,
but Dad will take care of you like he used to,
when I was a kid. That'll make up." Another
pause. "Pa, ma, make the Act of Contrition
with me." They knelt at his side, made the
sign of the cross, and he said, falteringly but
clearly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O my God! I am heartily sorry for
having offended Thee, and I detest all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
my sins, because I dread the loss of
heaven and the pains of hell, but most of
all because they offend Thee, my God,
who art all-good and deserving of all my
love. I firmly resolve, with the help of
Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do
penance, and to amend my life. Amen."</p></div>

<p>He fell back exhausted, from his slightly
raised position.</p>

<p>In a little while he said, "Ma, I want Father
Boone and Frank." The mother knew that
the priest was rushed day and night, and hesitated
to call him. Then she remembered that
Father Boone had said, "If he returns to
consciousness, be sure and send for me."</p>

<p>While she was thinking how best to do so,
Mr. Roberts entered the room. He took in
the situation at a glance. "Is there anything
I can do for you?" he asked. On learning of
Bill's request, he said, "My machine is here.
I'll run up for Father Boone and the boy,
and have them here in no time," and off he
went.</p>

<p>Mother and father held either hand of their
darling. Not a word was uttered. In about ten
minutes, the door opened and Father Boone
and Frank appeared. Bill recognized the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
priest, and said with an effort, "I am&mdash;&mdash;so
glad&mdash;&mdash;to see&mdash;&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;Father. I want to
go to confession. Then I'll go home." Mr.
Roberts, who was not a Catholic, found tears
running down his cheeks. Mr. Daly was
sobbing.</p>

<p>"I shall have to ask you all to leave the
room for a few minutes," said the priest, and
as they filed out, he put on his sacred stole,
and blessed the boy. Then bending over him,
he heard Bill's confession.</p>

<p>Bill told him everything. He wanted to go
into details, but the priest, to whom a single
word meant volumes, quieted him and allowed
him to say only what was absolutely necessary.
When his confession was made, the
priest took out a crucifix and pointing to it,
said, "He came for us, for us who offended
Him. He is more glad to forgive you than you
are to receive forgiveness. Make your act of
contrition, and I shall pronounce God's absolution.
Speak from your heart as to Christ
on the Cross. He sees your repentance. He
will heal you and make you His dear child."</p>

<p>As the dying lad was saying his words of
sorrow for sin, the priest was pronouncing
absolution. "May Almighty God have mercy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
on you and forgive you your sins and bring
you to life everlasting, Amen. May the
Almighty and Merciful Lord grant you pardon,
absolution and remission of all your sins.
Amen. May Our Lord Jesus Christ absolve
you, and I, by His Authority, do absolve you
from every stain of sin. I absolve you from
your sins in the name of the Father, and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. May
the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the
merits of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of all
the Saints, whatever good you have done and
whatever suffering you have borne, make for
the forgiveness of your sins, for an increase
of grace, and for the reward of life eternal.
Amen."</p>

<p>Father Boone arose, opened the door and
bade all come in. "All please kneel down,"
he said, "I am going to give William, Holy
Viaticum." They all knelt, including Mr.
Roberts. Before the priest administered the
sacred rite, he turned to the boy and said,</p>

<p>"My child, I am bringing to you Our Lord
Himself, to be your friend and companion.
Speak your heart to Him." Then administering
the Blessed Sacrament, he said,</p>

<p>"Receive, my child, the Holy Viaticum, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ. May He
guard you against the evil one and conduct
you to life everlasting. Amen."</p>

<p>The boy received the Sacred Host with intense
reverence and joy. He crossed his
arms in prayer. After a short while, he turned
to his mother and said, "God wants me,
mother."</p>

<p>She responded, "The Lord giveth, the Lord
taketh away; blessed be the name of the
Lord."</p>

<p>The father came over to his son, and taking
his hand kissed it, saying with a voice of
suppressed emotion, "Good-bye, Willie, pray
for your poor old Dad."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Dad. A kiss."</p>

<p>His eyes caught Frank kneeling beside the
bed and he faintly smiled at him.</p>

<p>Then, to his mother, "Good-bye, Ma."</p>

<p>She kissed his forehead tenderly. He looked
up a moment, and closed his eyes. Father
Boone and Frank were just saying, "Holy
Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now, and at the hour of our death," when the
mother gave a gasp and said, "My Willie is
dead!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />(V)</div>

<p>On the way home an hour later, Frank and
the priest walked for a while in silence. Each
had his own thoughts. In an indefinable way,
the priest showed a marked respect for the
boy. He understood all now, "A truly noble
boy," he kept saying to himself. But Frank
occupied only a part of his thoughts. The
mysterious ways of God's Providence furnished
him food for reflection. "A soul saved,
a life lost," he said to himself, as he considered
the reform of Mr. Daly and the death of Bill.</p>

<p>Frank, too, had his thoughts. His tired
head was full of all he had seen and heard
of Bill's life and family. Bill was a "victim
of circumstances." "What if my father had
been like his?" he asked himself. "I have
never thanked God enough for my good father
and mother." Then he was glad both for
Bill's sake and for his own that Bill had gone
to confession. In his own relief at knowing
that the strain of misunderstanding was
ended for both himself and Father Boone,
he expected the priest momentarily, to refer
to the subject. When they had gone a distance
in silence, Frank burst out&mdash;the first
words between them since leaving the hospital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, you know all about it now!"</p>

<p>"All about what, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Why, didn't he tell you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about the
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." here he stopped. The priest gave
him a look that startled him. "O, I beg your
pardon, Father, I forgot it was confessional."</p>

<p>From that moment the subject never came
up again. But Frank knew in his heart that
he was cleared. It would not matter now, no
matter what happened. The subject never
came up again, but in a thousand ways, from
that night on, Frank realized that Father
Boone was his dearest and best friend.</p>

<p>Switching the conversation, Father Boone
said, "Our prayers for Daly tomorrow will
be for his welfare beyond, not here."</p>

<p>"It will be a great shock to the fellows,
Father," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, doubtless. Death always is. And the
death of a boy especially."</p>

<p>"Why, Father?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose because we don't expect
the young to die. It seems out of place. But
God calls at all hours. After all, it's only a
question of a few years, more or less. We all
go sooner or later. The great thing is not
the going, but the manner of it&mdash;to live in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a way that whenever God calls, we are ready.
Then, it's all one,&mdash;for compared with eternity,
the longest life is but a fraction of a second.
Not even that."</p>

<p>They soon reached the rectory. "Good-bye,
Frank, my good boy Frank," and the
priest gave him a hand shake that almost
made him yell.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Father."</p>

<p>And when in later years Frank recalled that
night, he marvelled that one small boy could
have been both so sad and so happy.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI</h2>

<h3>The Cost of Honor</h3>


<p>The next morning at about ten, Father
Boone was in his office at the Club, waiting
for Mr. Roberts, who had phoned him asking
for an appointment.</p>

<p>"This has been a crowded week," said the
priest to himself. "On Monday morning I
found the Club rooms a wreck. Since then,
we have had a fire, Bill Daly's adventure and
death, all the worry over the mystery and,
thank God, its solution.</p>

<p>"All cleared up now. And out of it comes
Frank Mulvy, pure gold. He had a hard
ordeal, poor boy. I was certainly severe on
him. But under the same circumstances, yes,
I'd do the same again. What a <i>mirage</i> life is!
We see or fancy we see, so many things that
are not there."</p>

<p>Presently, Mr. Roberts was shown in, and
after the usual greeting, he said, "I know you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
are busy, Father, and so I won't take up
much of your time. You know I had intended
putting William Daly through school, but
that's off now."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Father Boone, "he knows
more now than all the colleges could impart."</p>

<p>"Say, Father Boone, do you know it's
taken my breath away&mdash;the way you people
look at things. You talk and feel about the
other world as we do about this! Why, last
night, everybody seemed to be right next door
to God."</p>

<p>"That's our Faith," replied the priest.
"It's our greatest treasure, the best thing we
have in life. That is, for those of us who live
up to it."</p>

<p>"It must be so, Father. I couldn't help but
notice how happy that boy looked after the
Sacraments. But, I came on another matter
today. William Daly is dead. What I was
going to do for him I want to do for some
other whom you will designate. Preferably,
that young lad who was with you last night.
But I leave it to you."</p>

<p>"God will bless you for that. But Frank
Mulvy comes of a well-to-do family. He is
one of the finest lads that God ever made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
He intends going to college after finishing at
our high school. I have another boy, however,
very deserving and very poor. If you will
consent, I should like to designate him. His
name is Edward Morgan."</p>

<p>"Edward Morgan it shall be," replied Mr.
Roberts.</p>

<p>"Now, another thing, Father. I have told
Mrs. Daly to have as nice a funeral as possible
for her boy. That's not an act of kindness,
but of justice. He saved my wife and child.
I shudder when I think what life would be
without them. All my money would be nothing,
with them gone. Of course I shall take
good care of Mr. Daly," he added.</p>

<p>"I am sure you are doing the part of a good
and grateful man," said Father Boone.</p>

<p>"And another little thing, Father. We are
close on to Christmas. I want to do something
for you personally, for yourself, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I thank you very much," said the priest,
"but, really, I prefer to have you help some
one else."</p>

<p>"No, it must be you, Father. I am set. I
want to do something to please you, personally."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, you do! Well now, I'll tell you how you
may do that. I have any number of poor
people in the parish. Some need clothing,
some food, some rent. Suppose you help me
to help them?"</p>

<p>"I'll go the limit, Father, I have the money.
You send me word how much you need, and
you will have it."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my good man. I only want you
to help to a certain extent. You know we have
many poor. I could easily ask you for a large
sum and not half supply our needs. Just how
much do you wish to give?"</p>

<p>"How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have at least thirty poor families
on my list."</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," said Mr. Roberts, "that
we make it a hundred dollars to each family.
How would that suit?"</p>

<p>Father Boone felt like calling for help.
Three thousand dollars! It almost toppled him
over. "Suit!" he exclaimed, "why, it will be
royal! Rather, let me say, it will be very
Christian, Christlike."</p>

<p>"It's done," said Mr. Roberts.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Father Boone earnestly.</p>

<p>"I thank <i>you</i>," replied the millionaire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Then he continued: "I see you are doing a lot
here for the boys. That is the best work I
know of. If you turn out others like Frank
and William, you ought to be blessed and
thanked. I know your heart is with your
boys. Can't I do something for the Club?"</p>

<p>They talked over the situation for some
time, with the result that the Club was to
get a new piano, new up-to-date billiard
tables, a bowling alley, and six sets of boxing
gloves. All these were to be delivered Christmas
week.</p>

<p>As Mr. Roberts was leaving, the priest
said, "It's my turn now to do something for
you. I am going to ask you to do a little favor
for yourself. I want you to kneel down every
night before going to bed and say a prayer.
It's not a long one, just this: 'O God, grant
me the grace to see the light, and the courage
to follow it.'"</p>

<p>"Why, that's easy," said Mr. Roberts. "I
thought you were going to ask me something
big."</p>

<p>"Well, for all you know, that may turn out
to be the biggest thing you have ever done,"
replied Father Boone, as they clasped hands
on parting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Boone's thoughts just now had
turned to the McCormack concert. After
the disturbance, he had sent the tickets to a
priest down town, who had a boys' club in a
poor section of the city. "But I don't know as
it's too bad," he thought. "Those boys down
there never get much of anything. I'll find
some way to make it up. The boys won't
suffer for my mistake, that's certain."</p>

<p>He phoned down to Carnegie Hall.</p>

<p>"Sold out," was the answer.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he reflected, not at all disappointed.</p>

<p>That afternoon while down town on business,
he turned over 57th Street to Seventh
Avenue and dropped into Carnegie Hall to
see what other date McCormack was booked
for. While he was making his inquiries, a man
standing nearby approached him.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Father, you're from St. Leonard's?
I am Mr. McCormack's manager; perhaps I
can help you out." When he heard that
ninety seats were wanted, he almost collapsed,
"But your boys are little chaps, aren't they,
Father, from nine to fifteen? Lads of that
age don't take up much room. How would
you like to have them seated on the stage?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that's capital," exclaimed Father
Boone.</p>

<p>"Well, I can manage that. We'll give them
the first row on either side. That will put
them right close to McCormack while he's
singing. I know how kids like to be near to
what's going on."</p>

<p>So it was all arranged, and Father Boone
returned home very happy. He had received
that very morning a letter from one of the
parishioners who always gave him something
for the Club at Christmas. This time it was
a check for $150.00. The tickets cost him
$90.00. "With the rest," he mused, "I shall
be able to give them a good time."</p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>That evening the boys were rather subdued.
Bill Daly's death had affected them
greatly. To be playing with a lad on Monday,
and to know he is dead on Friday, is a terrible
shock to boys.</p>

<p>As Father Boone entered the Club he observed
how serious they were. It was natural,
he reflected, and best to let it work itself out.
He would not mention the McCormack treat
just now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys gathered around him, and asked
all sorts of questions about Bill's last moments.
Even to these lads it meant something
consoling that he had died a beautiful
Catholic death. They told Father Boone that
they had gone to Mass in a body that morning,
and had received Holy Communion for
Bill's soul.</p>

<p>"I offered up the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass
for William this morning," said the priest,
"and I suggest that on the day of the funeral
you all go to Communion again in a body
for the repose of his soul."</p>

<p>"We had already decided on that, Father,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"That is good," remarked the priest, "and
now another thing. You know his mother is
terribly broken up by her boy's death. That
is natural. She would not be a mother otherwise.
Of course, she is resigned to God's will.
So was Our Blessed Mother, at the foot of the
Cross, but that did not prevent her heart
from being pierced with grief. Mrs. Daly was
very brave under it all. So much so that Mr.
Roberts, who was there, said to me afterwards,
'Your religion is a wonderful thing in
affliction.' But, boys, she feels the separation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
keenly. William was a remarkably good boy
to his mother. Now that he is dead, I can
say to you that the poor boy had an awful
lot to contend with, and if it were not for his
religion and his mother, no one can say how
he might have turned out.</p>

<p>"Now I suggest, boys, that you divide up,
and some of you go over to the house at one
time, and some at another, on a visit of condolence."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," said Tommy. "We were
thinking about going over."</p>

<p>"What's the best thing to say to her,
Father, if we want to show our sympathy?"
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the priest. "Words are
useless in deep sorrow. Just go there quietly.
Your mere presence will say more than any
words, if your behavior is considerate."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we say anything at all?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Just a word or two to say who you are,
and that you are sorry for her. Your presence
is what will talk most."</p>

<p>It was after ten o'clock that evening when
Father Boone reached the Daly flat. He had
been stopped several times on his way over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by inquiries about the Club, and Daly. On
entering he found six of the Club boys kneeling
around the body saying the rosary. The lads
had held a meeting after Father Boone had
left them, and decided to go in groups of six,
each group to stay a half hour. They also
decided that the best way they could show
their sympathy for the parents, and to aid
Bill, was to say the beads.</p>

<p>In order not to disturb them, Father Boone
went quietly into the rear room. Some one
told Mrs. Daly that the priest was come, and
she went to him at once. As soon as she saw
Father Boone, she broke down. The priest
had expected it. He had seen less devoted
mothers become hysterical under such circumstance.
He simply said nothing. He let
her have her cry out. When it was over, he
remarked, "That's good now; that cry will
do you good." He spoke kindly, but very
firmly. He knew that one little exhibition
of his own feelings would start her all over
again.</p>

<p>When she was composed, she said, "O,
but Father, what lovely boys you have at the
Club! Sure, they came in here in droves all
the evening, and every one of them knelt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
down and said the rosary for Willie. It did my
heart good. Forgive me, Father, for the cry
I had. They gave me so much comfort, I
thought I was altogether resigned to God's
blessed will. But the sight of you, Father,
brought the tears."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not surprised at that, my good
woman. Did not our Lord have tears of blood
in Gethsemani? Yet He was resigned. The
end of His prayer was, 'Not my will, but
Thine be done.' If we did not feel these things
keenly, there would be little merit in being
resigned to God's will."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Father, for saying that. I
was afraid I was rebellious."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You were only human, only a
mother."</p>

<p>Again she started to cry, and the priest sat
silent.</p>

<p>After a moment he said, "And now, Mrs.
Daly, remember that by offering up your
sorrow to God for Willie, it becomes something
precious in the sight of heaven, and will
benefit his soul."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Father, I'll do like you say.
But Father, you should see himself. I never
thought he would take it so hard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Inside."</p>

<p>"Tell him to come here."</p>

<p>In a moment Mr. Daly came in. There were
no signs of tears on his face, just a drawn, sad
expression. His eyes were sunken and dull.
He began first.</p>

<p>"O Father, it's the hand of God on me and
I deserve it. If the home was what it should
be, it never would have come to this."</p>

<p>"Well, Michael, if it's the hand of God, and
it is, it is for your good. The hand of God will
never lead you away from your true welfare."</p>

<p>"But it's the Missus I'm thinking about,
Father. It will kill her. I can stand it. But
she can't. Oh, if the good God had taken me
instead!" He sighed heavily. "Of course,
I feel Willie's going, too, almost as much as
the mother, for I had just found him again.
All these years he was lost to me, and mine
the fault, the crime I should say, and it is
God that is punishing me."</p>

<p>"I believe it, Michael. And He is punishing
you here rather than hereafter. But His
chastisements are different from men's. He
draws good from His punishments. This will
make a man of you, and you will save your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
soul. It brings God and His judgments before
you. It shows you that we never know when
He may call us, and that we should all be
ready. Suppose He had called you suddenly
two weeks ago, where would you be now?"</p>

<p>Michael said not a word. He just bowed his
head.</p>

<p>Father Boone continued, "Be a man,
Michael. Take your sorrow as chastisement
from God. You deserve it, as you know. You
did not appreciate the child God gave you,
and He took him. Live now as a good man
and husband. Don't worry over the Missus.
Her faith will take care of her."</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Mrs. Daly came in.
Turning to her, he said, "Mrs. Daly, I feel
sorry for you and Michael, but I do not feel
sorry for the boy. Willie is now with God.
He died the way Christ wants His followers
to die. He is with God now. He would not
exchange places with the most fortunate person
in this world. He would not come back
again if he could. God grant that you and I
may finish our journey to eternity as acceptably
as he has done!"</p>

<p>"Blessed be the holy will of God," responded
the mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Amen," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Now I am proud of you," declared the
priest. "Your sorrow is great, but like true
followers of Christ you carry your cross after
Him. That is why He had His way of the
Cross, so that when we have ours, we shall not
be alone. Come into the front room and let
us say a prayer for Willie's soul."</p>

<p>As they entered, the friends sitting around
stood up. The six lads saying the beads continued
their prayers, but on seeing Father
Boone, they terminated the rosary at the
decade they were saying.</p>

<p>When all was silence, the priest spoke out,
"My dear people, let us all say the 'Our
Father' for the repose of William's soul.
When we come to 'Thy Will be done,' we shall
pause for a moment, and dwell particularly
on those words. All please kneel."</p>

<p>He began: "In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.
Our Father....who art in heaven....hallowed be
Thy name....Thy kingdom come....THY....WILL....BE
DONE....on earth....as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread....and
forgive us our trespasses....as we forgive
those....who trespass against us....and lead us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
not into temptation....but deliver us from
evil....Amen. May Willie's soul, and the souls
of all the faithful departed, through the
mercy of God rest in peace. Amen."</p>

<p>He rose from his knees and quickly and
quietly left the room. The boys soon followed,
for it was late. One by one the others left,
and the father and mother were alone with
their dead. They sat silent for a long time.
Then Mrs. Daly touched her husband's arm
and said, "Michael, let us kneel down and
say the 'Our Father,' the way Father Boone
did."</p>

<h2>Chapter VII</h2>

<h3>Knighted</h3>


<p>The day after the funeral of Bill Daly,
Frank was on his way down to school when
he met Dick and Ned.</p>

<p>"I say, Frank," began Dick, "don't you
think you better do something about that
Club row?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done, as far as I
can see, Dick."</p>

<p>"That's because you're not hearing what
we hear. But it won't be long before you get
it, too. It's just got to us, because they know
we're friends of yours."</p>

<p>"Well, in the name of Sam Hill, what is it
you hear?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Want it straight?" asked Ned. "The
word's round that the Club is going to be
disbanded, and that you're the cause of it.
I almost got into a fight with the first guy that
told me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," added Dick, "and they say that the
best fellows are getting out on account of
you."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Some one saw three or four of the fellows'
mothers coming from the rectory the last few
days, and one of them asked Joe Rooney if his
mother was going to let him stay in the Club.
You know Joe's father keeps a store on 42nd
Street and is somebody. Well, Joe is true blue
even if he is a dude, and he said, 'Why
shouldn't I stay in the Club?' She said, 'Oh,
I thought all the decent boys had left. I
can't have my boy ever put his foot in that
place again, with that pack of rowdies.'"</p>

<p>This was news for Frank, but to their surprise
he showed little concern.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Hank," said Dick, "that
you are getting in bad. If a lot of mud is
thrown, some will stick. It's easy to give a
fellow a bad name, but it's hard to get rid of
it. Why don't you do something? I am sure
Father Boone also will get a lot of annoyance
from it, unless you clear yourself."</p>

<p>But Frank did not seem to mind. It was so
unlike him that Ned said, "If we didn't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
you so well, Frank, we'd think you were
mixed up in it ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes," declared Dick, "to one on the outside
it looks bad for you. That Dunn kid
told everybody that you were over to see his
father and then someone else blabbed what
happened in the Club, that you owned up to
knowing all about it. Putting two and two
together, they have built up an ugly story,
and it's spread like fire."</p>

<p>"That's all right, fellows," replied Frank
nonchalantly, as they parted at the school.
But just the same Frank was doing a lot of
thinking. "Suppose the decent fellows should
leave the Club! Suppose it got a rowdy name!</p>

<p>"But," he went on, "Father Boone knows
how things are, and he'll straighten them out.
But can he? What he knows, he does not
know, for all intents and purposes. He can't
use what he got in confession, and that's all
he got. He may know that I am right. That
settles something. But how about my mother,
and the others?"</p>

<p>These reflections came to Frank as he was
going upstairs to his class room. It was a
relief to know that his teacher had some confidence
in him. Some of the boys gave him sly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
looks and one or two made insinuations. At
recess, however, he met his real ordeal. First
one, then two, and at length a dozen or more
had gathered around him.</p>

<p>"Well, fellows, you are getting a good show,
I hope," laughed Frank, with a forced grin.
As they kept on staring he added, in a tone
trying to be pleasant, "Movies free today."</p>

<p>Outside the circle someone called, "What's
up over there?"</p>

<p>The reply cut him through and through.
"That's the goody-good kid that got caught
in the roughneck stuff over at the Club."</p>

<p>If a thrust were made designedly in order
to inflict exquisite pain, it could not have
served the purpose better. Frank moved off
with hot iron in his very flesh. He knew that
the last word in contempt among boys was
that same "goody-good." It implied everything
that he detested. With the boys it
meant a girlish goodness, a sort of "softy."
That hurt him. Of course, in a school where
there were nearly a thousand boys, he was
known only to his own set. He was not thinking
of them, but of the great crowd who knew
him but slightly, and who would credit what
they heard. And out over the whole yard had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rung those words, "goody-good!" And on
the top of that, to be called a "roughneck!"</p>

<p>In class the next hour, the recess and its
every incident occupied Frank's whole mind.
Every word and look was rehearsed over and
over again. He was called on for recitation,
but his name had to be repeated before he
responded. When he did reply, he appeared
like one just out of a trance. The hour of
class seemed very long.</p>

<p>At noon, he delayed going out in order not to
face the crowd. When he thought that most
of the boys had gone, he went out into the
street. His face was burning. He fancied
everyone he met was looking at him. He
could almost hear passersby say "goody-good"
and "roughneck."</p>

<p>If Frank had been "just any boy," the
experience of the recess hour would not have
caused him such exquisite anguish. But a boy
of high honor resents with all his soul the
insinuation that he appears one thing, while
in reality he is another. "But why," he reflected,
almost aloud, "why should I carry a
load that is not mine? I did not ask Daly's
confidence. Why should I suffer for it?" He
knew the answer, at once. Honor demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
it, and honor's price at times comes high.
That is what makes its value. But the thing
kept coming back. It would not let him alone.
When apparently settled, it came again in a
new form.</p>

<p>"Daly is gone," he reflected. "He hasn't
got to face a crowd and bear their jeers and
insults. I kept this secret as long as it could
possibly hurt him any. Now, what's the harm
in clearing myself?"</p>

<p>This thought clung to him like a wet garment.
It looked right, but his fine sense of
honor detected the wrong that lurked in it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "Daly is gone, but his
father and mother are here. What a blow it
would be to them!"</p>

<p>But back again came the temptation, were
his own father and mother not to be considered
also? Did he not owe more to them
than to Bill Daly's parents? And so he went
on, balancing duty with duty. Yes, it certainly
was right for him to clear himself. This conclusion,
however, did not satisfy him either.</p>

<p>"Two things are against it," he mused.
"First, any crook can accuse the silent dead.
I am free of guilt, but I must not establish
my innocence by making the dead guilty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Moreover, who would believe me? They'd all
say that a fellow mean enough to wreck a
club room, would be mean enough to lie. It
wouldn't do me any good to speak out.</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;Bill Daly's death made a profound
impression on everybody. Father
Boone's sermon at the funeral was as good as
a mission. All that would be undone if I let
out on Daly. I can live this thing down, he
can't. Should I, even because of the pain of
this thing to myself and my father and mother,
break up all that? No. Not even if I was sure
it would help my case. I know I am right
with God. That counts most. If I am doing
something for Him, I must do it right. No
whining, nor complaining, nor getting amazed
that I am ill-treated. All that goes with the
sacrifice."</p>

<p>He entered the church and went to the altar
of the Sacred Heart. "O my God, for the
love of Thee, I do this. I offer Thee a bleeding
heart. It costs me much, but I am glad to
give Thee what does cost so much. And, my
dear Lord, grant me the grace to give cheerfully
what I give. Amen."</p>

<p>He arose and went out, strong and buoyant,
like the martyrs who went to the lions rejoicing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
"A soldier fights for the flag," he
thought, "and does so with enthusiasm, although
he may meet with wounds, capture
and death. I must fight under the standard of
the Cross, and be a brave soldier of Christ,
a Knight of the Cross."</p>

<p>There was no school that afternoon and so
he took his time getting home. On his way,
he was met by Mrs. Joyce, mother of one of
the Club members.</p>

<p>"Aren't you that Mulvy boy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Joyce," he replied.</p>

<p>"I thought so," she continued. "Well,
you've been found out at last."</p>

<p>That was all. It was a terrible lot for
Frank's sensitive soul, but he said in his heart,
"For Thee, Jesus," and went bravely on. At
home, a new trial was awaiting him. His
mother had been stopped on the street several
times this morning, and had received very
pointed inquiries about her boy. The last
woman who addressed her had virtually insulted
her.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Mulvy, it's too bad. Who
would have thought that your boy, Frank,
would turn out so bad!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvy had to make an effort to smile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and not reply. But when she got home, she
found that she had bit her lips even to blood.</p>

<p>When Frank came in, doubly dear to her
now, she almost lost control of herself. She
sank with a groan into the large arm chair.
Frank was at her side in a second, smothering
her with kisses, and breathing out terms of
endearment to her. In a moment, she was
herself again.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Frank," she said, "I was all
undone. But tell mother, dear, what in the
world have you done?"</p>

<p>Frank was brave for himself. But where his
mother was concerned, it was different. He
knew now that what he had promised at the
altar was going to cost him much dearer even
than he had calculated. He was strongly
tempted to make an exception in his mother's
case, and to tell her all. But he remembered
his promise at the altar and how Bill himself
had said, "There's no going back on a promise
to Him."</p>

<p>"A soldier does not quit when he gets a
blow, neither will I," he reflected. "This blow
is worse because it strikes me through my
mother, but I will trust God, and do what I
have promised Him. Moreover, if mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
could not trust me now, when I tell her I am
blameless, would it do any good to tell her the
dime-novel truth of the matter?"</p>

<p>Looking deep into her eyes, he said,
"Mother, you never knew me to deceive you.
You must trust me now more than ever. But
I will tell you more than I shall say to any
other human being. Mother, there is a mistake.
Everything points to me, I know. I'm
under this cloud because I would not be untrue
to a confidence. I've just left the church,
where I promised God to carry this cross for
Him. I was thinking of you when I made that
offering. Now, Mother, won't you be good
and not worry any more?"</p>

<p>For an answer she embraced him, and taking
him by the hand, she led the way to the
little oratory. They knelt down before the
Sacred Heart, and still holding his hand in
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'her's'">hers</ins>, she said, "Dear Sacred Heart, I add
my offering to my boy's. Do thou keep him
ever in Thy love and Thy Grace. Amen."</p>

<p>"It's all right now, mother. The cross has
lost its weight."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she answered, "we won't
mind anything now. I'll tell your father that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
I know things are all right, so he won't be
embarrassed by any gossip he hears."</p>

<p>"Mother, I'd rather you wouldn't say anything
to father. He has enough to worry him
without our cares."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, things don't always run smoothly
with him, yet he spares us his worries.
I'll do as you say, unless something makes me
see it's best to tell him."</p>


<div class='center'><br />(II)</div>

<p>After lunch, Frank went out to the football
field. There was to be heavy practice that
afternoon for the big game of the year. On
his way, he met Dick and Ned, headed in the
same direction.</p>

<p>"O Frank," exclaimed Ned, "you're being
terribly 'roasted' all over the parish. Somehow
the thing is getting bigger and bigger,
and you're made out worse and worse."</p>

<p>"Can't help people talking, son," was
Frank's reply.</p>

<p>"I know, Hank, but it's something awful.
Why don't you do something?"</p>

<p>"I'm open to suggestions, wise one. What
do you advise me to do?"</p>

<p>"Why, deny it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Well, tell them that you can prove you
didn't do it. Show 'em that you were not
around there when it happened."</p>

<p>"That's just it. Who knows when it
happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, isn't there anything you can do?
It's fierce to get the rep you're getting."</p>

<p>"Search me, kid. I don't know anything
more that I can do."</p>

<p>As they approached the field, they found
most of the players already on hand, in their
uniforms. Subs were beginning to line up
against the regulars, for the practice, but
Frank noticed at a glance that John Derby,
of the second team, was in a regular uniform.</p>

<p>"Oho," he thought, "that looks strange.
And that uniform looks suspiciously like
mine!" His heart sank.</p>

<p>Of all things that Frank liked, football came
first. In the last game, with Grayson High,
his playing had certainly counted big in winning
the game for Regal. He was the only
boy from his year on the team but no one
could run and dodge as fast. His grit helped,
too, for he would fight on, no matter how
rough he was handled. In the early fall, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
had been carried off the field protesting, although
he was terribly bruised. Considering
all this, it seemed impossible that Derby had
been promoted to his uniform on the eve of
their biggest game. Tomorrow they were to
play Stanley High for the Interscholastic
championship.</p>

<p>However, he hurried, with as much coolness
as possible, to the dressing room. He found
his locker empty. Standing nearby was the
captain of the team, Robert Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Bob?" said Frank,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Didn't they tell you, Mulvy?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what?"</p>

<p>"That you're off."</p>

<p>"Why, no. This is the first notion I've had
of it. I came out for practice."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather someone else told you,
Mulvy. I just want to say we had a hot row
over you. I stood up for you, but four of the
players said they'd resign unless you were
dropped. So I had to give in, or 'bust' the
team."</p>

<p>"What's the charge against me, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you ought to."</p>

<p>"I know the report that's around," said
Frank, "but you fellows certainly don't want
to go on record for condemning a man before
he's heard?"</p>

<p>"Why, they said you admitted it."</p>

<p>"That's not so. I said I knew about it. I
did not need to say that. I had my knowledge
as a confidence, and I could have denied all
knowledge of it. But because I had the spunk
to speak out as I did, you fellows brand me.
It's all right. I'll take my medicine."</p>

<p>"It wasn't easy for us to drop you, Mulvy.
Tomorrow is the big game, and we need our
best team. I put that before them strong.
But I was out-voted."</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, I want to thank you for what
you did. But tell me one thing. You know
how the fellows move heaven and earth to
get a strong team. You know how, when a
fellow got into a scrape, or was behind in
studies, or even if he was bounced, all the
others stood by him and fought to retain
him. Now, I know I'm a boob, but nevertheless,
I know my worth to the team, and so do
you. Tell me, then, why this action in my
regard?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll be frank with you, Mulvy. They
look upon this matter differently. From all
accounts, it was a thug affair, and it's gotten
all over the parish. The fellows won't stand
for it, not even if it hurts our chances for
tomorrow's game."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Bob, for being so frank. Now,
another question. It's my last, don't be afraid
to be candid. Do you think the same as the
others?" For a moment there was no reply.</p>

<p>"O, excuse me," said Frank, "I did not
mean to embarrass you. Please don't answer."</p>

<p>Turning, he saw five or six of the team
standing about. They had all heard the conversation.
Not one had come forward to
befriend him.</p>

<p>"It's all right, fellows, I have no kick. I'm
in bad. But I hope you'll find out some day
that I'm misrepresented."</p>

<p>So saying, he walked away, down-hearted,
but full of exultation. He was paying a high
price for that offering to the Sacred Heart.
It hurt. But he was glad that he was doing
something worth while for God.</p>

<p>He left the field. He could not bear to stay
and look on. He had not gone far when Dick
and Ned overtook him. "Say, fellows, don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
mind me," he said to them. "Go back and
take in the sport."</p>

<p>"Not without you," said Dick.</p>

<p>At the same time, Ned put his hand in his,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>Frank's eyes filled. Here was trust. Here
was devotion. They walked along for five
minutes, not a word being spoken. Rather,
many words were uttered, but they were the
silent language of the heart.</p>

<p>"I think I'll see Father Boone," Frank
said eventually. "I want to get his advice on
something. Good-bye fellows. I'll never forget
how true you were to me." And he headed off
in the direction of the Club, hoping to find
the priest in his office there.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(III)</div>

<p>Father Boone was in and he was very
serious, as it was easy to see from his face and
manner. For he had just heard how his boy,
Frank, was being treated.</p>

<p>"Of course," he meditated, "my lips are
sealed. All that I know is confessional. But
I must think out some way of coming to
Frank's rescue. What a chivalrous lad he is!
What a fine sense of honor! He'll see it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
through, no matter what the cost. I trust that
most of my boys would suffer anything rather
than lie or do wrong. But this is heroic. It
shows fine mettle. His religion is his strength.</p>

<p>"But can I allow him to be a victim of
injustice? Daly knew the secrecy of the confessional
but, at the same time, I told him
that I could not give him absolution unless he
repaired the wrong he did, as far as lay in
his power. The only thing in his power then,
was to give me permission to use what he
told me. I told him plainly that someone else
was under suspicion of the deed. I pointed
out that in case that one were in danger of
incurring the guilt and punishment, it was a
matter of justice on his part to assume the
responsibility of the act.</p>

<p>"Of course he gave me the authorization to
declare that he and he alone was the author
of the damage. He even begged me to do it,
for his peace of soul and as penance for his
sins. He showed he had the right disposition
for absolution. But it's not all right for me.
He was too weak to sign a paper and if I
were to use the knowledge I have, what
would prevent people from saying that I was
violating the sacred seal? My word alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
could be questioned by anyone. A slur on the
confessional would result, and untold harm
would be done.</p>

<p>"But here I am discussing the matter, as
though it were open to discussion. No, I was
just ruminating. My lips are sealed forever."</p>

<p>Just then there was a rap at the door, and
in came Frank. The priest arising said, "God
bless you, Frank." They stood and looked at
each other for a moment. Father Boone extended
his hand. Frank clasped it. They
understood.</p>

<p>Then Frank unburdened himself to the
priest. He told him all the snubs he got, and
finally came to the football matter.</p>

<p>"That got me. You see, Father, they are a
square set of fellows. To take such action
right before the big game means that they
have me down bad. I don't blame them. I told
them I had no kick. But, gee whiz, it hurts!"</p>

<p>"Of course it hurts, boy, but don't you
suppose it hurts when a soldier goes over the
top and gets a bayonet in his breast? Or when
he gets gassed, or bombed? Perhaps you
think it's fun for an aviator to see his machine
crippled four thousand feet above ground and
to know he is dashing to death? They do all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that for flag, for country, for glory. We ought
to do our bit for God and our country above."</p>

<p>"Father, you've got a way of explaining
everything. I think if I had you around, I
could go through life as if it were a picnic."</p>

<p>"It's not much of a picnic, son; and I could
tell you some things worse than going over
the top."</p>

<p>"For instance?" suggested Frank.</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't you like to know now,
Frankie boy? But you won't. No, it is enough
that God sees and knows. He who has Him
for witness has enough."</p>

<p>"But what do you advise me to do about
this football business, Father?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to advise. All I can say
is 'watchful waiting.' But I can tell you this.
I have never yet known that a fellow who
does what is right, loses out. He may appear
for a time to have the worst of it, and he
may suffer a lot, but if he does what is right
to the end, he comes out on top. The trouble
is that most people are willing to do right for
a limited period, and then they give way.
That always loses. If God is to be trusted, it
is not for a day or a week, but always. I
don't mean to say that every good man has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
been justified before men, but this I do say,
that no good man has ever regretted his trust
in God, nor the price he paid for it."</p>

<p>"I feel now that I can stand anything,
Father."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk. Just act the same
way."</p>

<p>Frank went into the reading room and
glanced over the magazines. He took down
some books and looked them over. The
Club rooms were practically empty and his
mind was not on his reading. It was the matter
of football practice and how the new player
would do that chiefly recurred to him. After
about an hour and a half, as it was getting
dark, he put away his book and started for
home.</p>

<p>At Gody's corner, there was usually a crowd
of the Regal boys at this hour, and Frank
hesitated whether he would pass along that
way or go around the block. He had had
enough troubles for one day, and did not court
any more. To pass that crowd would mean
trouble of some sort, he was afraid. But suddenly
he wheeled around. "I'll go the way I
would in case nothing was up. If I once give
in to this thing, it will be my finish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>He accordingly walked towards the crowd.
As they saw him coming, he caught their looks
and nods in his direction. When he got alongside
of them, George Mooney, an upper class
boy, said sneeringly, "Why weren't you out
to the practice, Mulvy?"</p>

<p>Frank took all the wind out of his sails by
answering, "I was out there, but they fired
me. They had no room on the team for a
thug, they told me."</p>

<p>"Some sand, kid," said Fred Gaffney.
"You don't look like a fellow who'd do a
dirty trick."</p>

<p>"He has already done it, there's no question
of what he would do," retorted Mooney.</p>

<p>"Come here, kid," said Gaffney. "I'm
going to believe just what you say. Did you
have anything to do with that damage over
there?"</p>

<p>In a clear, straightforward manner, Frank
said, "No." And he looked Gaffney right in
the eye.</p>

<p>Gaffney, who was the biggest fellow in the
crowd, turned to the others and said, "Fellows,
I'm not looking for a fight, nor am I
going to run away from one. I'm going to
stand by this kid. Not that I think he needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
anyone to brace him up. He is well able to
take care of himself. But I'm going to stand
by him because I think fair play demands it.
What's got into you fellows. Doesn't a chap's
record count for anything? Hasn't Mulvy's
record always been good? If a fellow is white
all along, is he going to turn yellow over
night? Put on your thinking caps."</p>

<p>Frank's eyes were riveted on him, and they
were moist. Gaffney saw it. "Put out your
hand, kid. You're good enough for me," he
said.</p>

<p>"And for me." "And for me," others
echoed, for Gaffney was a leader.</p>

<p>"I thank you, fellows, and you particularly,
Gaffney," said Frank, as he moved along.
His steps seemed lighter. Gaffney, a real
leader as well as cheer leader for the games,
believed in him. Perhaps the thing would
blow over. Some others might put on their
thinking caps also. He hoped so.</p>

<p>When he got near his own street, he ran
into Dick, who had just met some of the fellows
who had been at the practice.</p>

<p>"I say, Hank," he began, "they had hot
work up at the field. Bully practice. The new
guy is going fine, they say."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you up?"</p>

<p>"No, but I got it from Fitzpatrick and Redmond,
who were there all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I don't see how he could jump in on such
short notice, and fill the place. But if he does,
so much the better."</p>

<p>"Will you be out at the game tomorrow?"
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"No, I don't see how I could stand it,"
replied Frank.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(IV)</div>

<p>It broke clear and bracing next morning.
It was football weather made to order. Everybody
was discussing the game. Stanley High
and Regal had even scores for the season.
They were tied for the championship, and
this game was to decide it. In the morning,
the boys got together at the school to rehearse
their cheers and songs. Gaffney was cheer
leader. By the time they had finished they
were worked up to a high pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>Louis Holten walked up to Gaffney at the
close and said, "We've got 'em licked, surely,
Gaff."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, boy. Stanley has something
to say about that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yep, Stanley's record is first class all right,
but you should have seen our bunch at it
yesterday. Nothing can stop them!"</p>

<p>"I hope so, Holten, but I'd feel better if
Mulvy were on the job."</p>

<p>"Mulvy! Why the fellow that takes his
place has him beaten a mile. Besides, the
fellows wouldn't play with that thug on the
team."</p>

<p>"I wish there were more thugs like him,
old man, that's my 'think.' And besides it's
a big mistake to put a new man in at the last
moment."</p>

<p>"Not if he's as good as this new man."</p>

<p>"O, I saw him yesterday, and I tell you
Louie, Mulvy entirely outclasses him. Derby
is big and strong, but Mulvy has head and
grit. And that's what counts."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see, old chap; we'll be there
with the yells."</p>

<p>"So long, Louie!"</p>

<p>"So long, Gaff!"</p>

<p>The crowd began to arrive at the field at one
o'clock. The game was scheduled for 2:30.
It was to be in four periods of fifteen minutes
each. There was to be an interval of one
minute between the quarters and of twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
minutes between the halves. As many visitors
were expected, some of whom would not know
much about the teams or the game, the names
of the teams and players were posted on a
large board at one side of the field. Under
the names were placed the scoring points,
so that those unacquainted with the game
would not have to show their ignorance.</p>

<p>The connoisseurs of the game explained to
the uninitiated just what a "touchdown"
was, and a "goal from the field." It was
harder to make clear what a "safety" meant.
The general description seemed to be that it
was when a player was caught with the ball
behind his own goal.</p>

<p>The crowd kept coming in faster and faster
as the hour approached. By two o'clock every
bit of desirable space was occupied. The field
was marked off with new lines which shone
clear and bright. Stanley was grouped on the
right, Regal on the left, the side nearest the
entrance. Automobiles fringed the outer
crowd. All was expectancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside, the two teams were straining at the
leash. The coaches had difficulty holding their
men quiet.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your strength walking about
and fretting," yelled Regal's coach. "You'll
need all you've got out there." But the boys
could not rest. They champed like horses at
the post.</p>

<p>The cheers from outside came sailing in.
That only increased their nervousness. A
few minutes before time to go out, they almost
needed to be tied. Every boy was chewing
gum, or biting his nails, or kicking something.
Finally the coach signalled attention.</p>

<p>"Now boys, go at them hard. This is no
tea party. Scare them from the start. It's
grit that wins. No quitter, no quarter. You're
off."</p>

<p>With a yell, they bounded out of the dressing
room and on to the field. They came out
on a trot, looking steady and confident. They
were greeted with "Regal, Regal! Rah, Rah,
Regal," from thousands of throats. "Give
them another," yelled Gaffney. "Regal,
Regal! Rah, Rah, Re&mdash;gal" soared across the
field.</p>

<p>An instant later, Stanley came out. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
got their welcome, "Stanley, Rah! Stanley,
Rah!... Rah! Rah! Stanley!"</p>

<p>The spectators were about equally divided.
Both sides were on fire with enthusiasm.
Those who knew the players pointed them
out to those who did not. The strong and
weak points of the respective teams were
adverted to and discussed.</p>

<p>Below, on the gridiron, the players were
limbering up. Some tossed the ball around,
others made short sprints, while a few kicked
the pig-skin, not far but accurately. The
warning whistle sounded. Off came the heavy
sweaters. Both sides ranged up in battle formation.
The ball was propelled by a mighty kick
far into Stanley's territory, and the fight
was on.</p>

<p>The battle surged to and fro. Neither side
showed any distinct superiority over the other.
The ball was pushed now down to Stanley's
goal, now down to Regal's. Either side, held
for downs within the shadows of its own goal
posts, invariably punted the ball back into
hostile territory. Time and again an onward
march was stopped by clever work and the
ball changed hands. The game went on in
this way for about ten minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly from scrimmage, the ball was
passed to Mulvy's substitute for a run forward.
The chance was good for a score. A
little clever dodging here and there would
mean a touchdown and six points for Regal.
The spectators rose to their feet, they stood
on tip toe, they craned their necks to see the
first score. All of a sudden, when within
fifteen feet of goal, the runner was tackled,
toppled, and the ball rolled into Stanley's
possession. A groan came from Regal as
Stanley picked up the ball, and carried it
down the field, whence it was gradually
worked over the line for a touchdown. They
failed, however, to kick goal, and the score
stood 6 to 0 in favor of Stanley.</p>

<p>No time was lost in renewing the battle, and
soon it was on as fiercely as before. The
Regal's coach was storming and stamping.</p>

<p>"I told them not to drop Mulvy," he
bawled. "This is no dude's game. That sub
has got no grit. Look at him now! He's got
cold feet, he is only half playing. Here,
Green, tighten up your belt. I'm going to
put you in the next quarter."</p>

<p>The cheer leader was frantically appealing
for encouragement from his yelling hordes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
They gave cheer after cheer, louder and
longer. The encouragement was telling. Again
Regal pushed the ball up the field. Again, a
fine opening presented itself and Derby got
the ball, and a good open track to the enemy
goal. Deafening cheers gave him wings.
Again a hostile player crossed his path and
brought him down like a bag of oats. A hiss
resounded over the field. The coach could
hardly wait for the quarter to be up. Gaffney
ran over from his cheering place to the bench,
and whispered to him.</p>

<p>"I know it," growled the coach, "I told the
bunch after yesterday's practice. He looked
good to them, but I knew he wouldn't do.
We're presenting the game to Stanley. It's
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'their's'">theirs</ins> without half trying. I'll put Green in
the next quarter."</p>

<p>"Green is not your man either. There's
just one way to save this game, and that's
to get Mulvy."</p>

<p>"Is he here?" fairly yelled the coach.</p>

<p>"No, but there are lots of machines. We
could run up to his place in five minutes. He
could dress in the car and be here for the next
half."</p>

<p>"It's no use, Gaff. He wouldn't come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Don't talk to me. I know boys. After the deal
he got yesterday, you couldn't get him here for
a million dollars."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, old man," assented
Gaffney.</p>

<p>The first quarter was up with the ball close
to Regal's line. The whistle saved further
scoring. During the minute's rest it was clear
that the Regal team were not dejected, but
desperate. For a few seconds they simply
looked at one another. The sub handicap
was simply too much for them. They knew
it was their own doing, and against the
coach's advice.</p>

<p>"Here, Green, get in there now, and show
the crowd that at least one fellow has grit."</p>

<p>The whistle sounded, the line-up was
formed, and again the battle was on. They
certainly played football. But they were up
against a crowd who also played. The attack
and defense continued as before. If Regal
could not gain a point, neither could Stanley.
On three or four occasions Regal might have
scored, with Mulvy playing. They were
afraid to risk anything with Green. They
played safe. But that never wins. It may stop
the enemy, but it will not bring victory. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
enemy could hold what it had, the game was
lost to Regal. The coach saw this. He also
saw the solution.</p>

<p>"O, if I only had Mulvy," he roared. He
stormed and stamped and said a lot beside
his prayers. Gaffney was working like a
Trojan. But it was no use. The battle was
see-saw. Now Regal, now Stanley. Neither
could break through. Again Gaffney came up
to the coach. He was exhausted from cheering
and from swinging his arms.</p>

<p>"I say, boss, it's all over, unless we get
Mulvy."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me or I'll eat you," snapped
the coach. "What's the use of saying Mulvy
when we haven't got Mulvy, and can't get
him."</p>

<p>"Will you put him in if I get him?"</p>

<p>Just then a yell went up from the Stanley
side. A long run brought the ball to within
a few feet of Regal's goal, and a score looked
certain. The coach was a sight. The veins in
his forehead stood out. His eyes were bulging.
All of a sudden, the Stanley player dropped the
ball, and the Regal captain seized it. That
saved that situation. The coach relaxed, but
still looked like a house on fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Again Gaffney said, "If I get Mulvy will
you put him in?"</p>

<p>"Ask me a foolish question, will you? Put
him in! I'll shove him in, and poke him down
the throats of that gang of quitters out
there."</p>

<p>Gaffney went over to his crowd. "We've
got to get Mulvy here, fellows," he shouted,
"Unless we do, it's good night."</p>

<p>"Well, it's good night, then," remarked
Tom Ruggeri, one of the upper class boys.
Then he added, "You don't suppose any one
would jump into the game after the dose he
got yesterday, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not any one, but some one, and I believe
Mulvy is just that some one," retorted Gaffney.</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead and get him then," was
the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You fellows don't know that boy. You
have him down as a thug. I'm going to show
you you're wrong."</p>

<p>He found Dick with Ned and Tommy.
"Hey, Dick, you're a friend of Mulvy's. We
want you to help us to get him here for the
second half. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not," answered Dick. "He has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
been humiliated enough already. To ask him
now to play with a crowd that kicked him out
yesterday is an insult."</p>

<p>"So, you won't come with me, kid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Gaffney went back to his crowd. "It's
all up, I guess. Let's work like blazes cheering,
that may start something."</p>

<p>Regal had the ball, but was pushed back to
its own goal. In a mix-up, a Regal player ran
back of his own goal line, and was grabbed
for a "safety," which added two points to
Stanley's score. There was dejection among
the Regal players and consternation among
their supporters.</p>

<p>Only three minutes of play remained before
the end of the first half. The teams struggled
doggedly. Regal was really playing splendidly,
but the handicap of a sub player was too
much. It seemed that Stanley just worked
that one weak spot. That was good generalship
on their part, but very trying on Regal.
With but one minute more of play, Stanley
got the ball and ran with it to within seven
yards of Regal's goal. They lined up to push
it through by sheer force. Regal made stout
defense, and held the enemy wonderfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
While the goal was still in imminent danger,
the whistle blew, and the first half was over.
Score, Stanley 8, Regal 0.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(V)</div>

<p>When Regal got to its quarters off the side
line, the coach pitched into his men. "You
bunch of babies, you ought to be playing
croquet, not football! Where's your 'sand'?
Haven't you got any spine?"</p>

<p>He was worked up to a terrible pitch. But
it was all lost on the team. They were dazed.
They had invited their friends to come out
and see them win. And here they were pushed
up and down the field, the score 8 to 0, and
likely to be 28 to 0 before the end.</p>

<p>The captain was the first to speak. "If I'd
had my way, it would now be 8 to 0 in our
favor. I told you not to drop Mulvy. I told
you not to believe that charge against him.
But you had your way, and now you see what
it's done."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we could get him for the
second half, Bob?" asked one of the team.</p>

<p>"What, after what we did to him? No."</p>

<p>Here Gaffney stepped up. "I say, fellows,
it was a dirty, mean trick the way you fellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
turned on Mulvy. Bob is the only fellow that
stood out for him."</p>

<p>"That's right, Gaff."</p>

<p>"Now I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm
going to show you that you're wrong on
Mulvy. I'm going to get him. I'll go for him
myself." He was off on the instant.</p>

<p>"If Mulvy comes here after our treatment
of him yesterday, I'll take my hat off to him,"
declared Bob to his dejected team.</p>

<p>"If he comes," declared Bill Cronin, "I'll
knock the head off the first fellow that ever
dares hint again that he was in that thug
affair."</p>

<p>That meant a good deal, for Cronin was the
strongest man on the team.</p>

<p>"I guess we made a mistake, boys," said
Joe Dalton. "As I look back now, I never
knew Mulvy to be anything but straight."</p>

<p>"We believed that report too readily,"
observed Fred Donohue. "I'm mighty sorry
for my part in it."</p>

<p>And so it went on. It stood out clearly now,
that they had little or no ground for their
action against Mulvy. But all felt that there
was no question of his coming back.</p>

<p>Out on the field, the Stanley contingent was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
jubilant. Songs and cheers rocked the stands.
The Regal supporters tried to look hopeful,
but not with any great success. There were
many inquiries about Mulvy. Some gave one
reason, some another, for his absence. Those
in the parish gave the Club story. But the
High School drew students from all over town,
and the parish affairs were not known outside.
The Stanley players were asking where Mulvy
was, for they knew him and his record. They
thought he was on the crippled list. Their
chief concern was joy over the score, and the
prospect of final victory, and the Interscholastic
Championship.</p>

<p>Gaffney, meanwhile, had got a closed auto
and had put into it a reserve uniform. It
seemed the traffic cops took him for an ambulance&mdash;for
he reached Frank's in five minutes.
He rushed upstairs, rang the bell, breathing
hard as he waited for the door to open.</p>

<p>Frank was with his mother and Father
Boone within. The priest knew that Frank
would feel it keenly that he was ostracized
from the team, and being sure also that he
would not go to the game, he had dropped in,
casually, as it were, to see Mrs. Mulvy.
Frank was really glad to see him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know, Father," he said, after the
casual remarks had all been made, "I've
been building castles in the air. I was imagining
that the game was hard fought, and that
our fellows were getting the worst of it. Then
I fancied they wished they had me with them,
and that they sent for me. I scorned them and
had my revenge!"</p>

<p>"That's quite a romance, Frank," said the
priest. "But I guess the boys are winning.
You know they said that that sub played
splendidly yesterday."</p>

<p>"I hope they are winning, Father. I was
just day-dreaming."</p>

<p>"But, Frank, suppose now that they did
actually send for you, would you scorn them;
would you refuse to go?"</p>

<p>"Well, Father, except for one thing. In
church this morning, I offered this injustice
to God as a sacrifice. If I should act resentfully,
it would spoil the sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Now, you are talking as a Christian, as a
Christian Knight. I'm proud of you. You
see, in a case like this, you would not be
obliged to go back to them. They ejected you.
You are free to go back or not. But to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
back, not being obliged to, and to do so for
the love of God, is virtue of a high order."</p>

<p>"You know, Father, Achilles went through
something like this, and he scorned the pleading
Greeks. But that was before Christ
came."</p>

<p>"Precisely. And look at the nuns and priests
of France. Banished from their country by an
infidel government. Yet, when their country
was in need of them they came back from all
quarters of the globe to suffer and, if need be,
die for her. That is the effect of Christ in
the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father, and do you remember how
differently Coriolanus acted? When he was
driven out of Rome, although he was naturally
a very noble man, he led an army against his
countrymen for revenge."</p>

<p>"Why, you are quite a historian and philosopher,
Frank."</p>

<p>At this point, the door bell rang and it was
followed at once by excited knocking. Frank
ran to the door and Gaffney rushed into the
room, all out of breath. Without stopping
to see who was there, he poured out his words
in such haste and with such excitement, that
he seemed almost beside himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mulvy, we're licked....the game is lost....almost
lost....They want you....They want
you....Mulvy, they want you!"</p>

<p>Frank looked in amazement at Father
Boone. The priest was a picture of astonishment.</p>

<p>"I've got a machine outside...the uniform
in it...come along...the second half...."</p>

<p>Before he got any further, Frank looked
understandingly at Father Boone, jumped to
his feet, and was down stairs like a shot.
Into the machine he rushed, then into the
uniform. The car fairly flew along the avenue.
By the time he had his uniform on and his
shoes tied, the car was at the field. Only two
minutes remained before the second half.</p>

<p>Bob saw Gaffney running towards the Regal
squad, waving his hands, and shouting, "I've
got him, I've got him."</p>

<p>And behind Gaffney, all in playing gear,
was Mulvy. Bob let out a yell that was
heard all over the field. Before he had time to
tell the cause of his excitement and jubilation,
Gaffney and Mulvy were in the midst of the
squad.</p>

<p>The awkward situation lasted but a second.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
"You're a brick, Mulvy," cried Bob, seizing
his hand.</p>

<p>The signal rang for the second half. The
coach rushed upon him. The boys jumped to
their feet and made for the field, full of new
life and courage. Each managed to fling him
a greeting that told better than words that
they knew they had been wrong and that they
were sorry for what they had done.</p>

<p>"You're all right, old man."</p>

<p>"You're a whole crowd, Mulvy."</p>

<p>"You're a brick!"</p>

<p>Why the expression, "You're a brick,"
carries so much weight with boys, no one can
analyze. But among any crowd of real boys,
it is the limit of hero worship.</p>

<p>Frank had nothing to say and no time to
say it. His presence there, fresh and eager for
the fight, showed that the incident was passed
and forgotten. The coach patted him on the
back, and whispered, "You've got to save the
day, kid, you can do it." And to them all it
was, to compare little things with great, what
the Yankees meant to Foch.</p>

<p>The squad on the field looked a different
aggregation. And it was different. The wonderful
thing "spirit" had permeated them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
It echoed in the rousing cheers which the
Regal supporters gave them.</p>

<p>"Great Guns!" gasped Dick, just as Gaffney
in front of the stand shouted through the
megaphone, "A Rah, Rah for Regal." From
thousands of throats came the inspiring,
"Regal, Regal! Rah, Rah, Re&mdash;gal!"</p>

<p>"Now, fellows, a big Rah Rah for Mulvy!"
Most of the spectators had supposed that
Mulvy was crippled and that he was pressed
into service as a last resort. Realizing that
an injured gladiator who fights on is a hero,
the response that came from the crowd was
tremendous.</p>

<p>"Mulvy, Mulvy, Rah, Rah, Mul. . .vy!"</p>

<p>"Give him another," yelled Gaffney.</p>

<p>Again, louder and more intensely, rang out
over the field, "Mulvy, Mulvy! Rah, Rah,
Mul . . . vy!"</p>

<p>The Stanley crowd shot back their yell,
"Stanley, Rah! Stanley, Rah! Rah! Rah!
Stan....ley!"</p>

<p>The Stanley squad noticed Mulvy, but
most of them thought he was crippled and
would not last long. None guessed the real
reason of his absence in the first half.</p>

<p>Again the whistle blew, the teams took their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
formation, and with a mighty kick by Stanley
the ball was in play. For a few moments
there was no apparent difference in Regal's
play. But soon it was noticed that they were
going like a well-oiled machine. Stanley, too,
seemed to be playing a better game. It was
good football all around. They were well
matched. It was to and fro again, but now
there was no looseness on Regal's side. Any
gain that was made against them was due to
good work by Stanley, not to poor play by
Regal.</p>

<p>Frank was playing well to the rear. All of
a sudden Stanley got the ball, passed it to
the fleetest runner, made an opening for him
and gave him a clear field to Regal's line.
Only Mulvy stood between him and a touchdown.
The runner was tall and fast, fifteen
pounds heavier than Frank, a big margin
where a boy is concerned. He came tearing
down the field with the ball. Frank rushed
right across his path, stood his ground with a
tigerish gleam and posture, and when his
man approached, tackled him low, sending
him sprawling to earth, the ball rolling away
to one side. The coach leaped into the air,
gave the bench a bang with his hand that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
drew blood, and exclaimed between his teeth,
"Grit."</p>

<p>The Regal crowd fairly went wild. Gaffney
swung his arms like a wind mill, and worked
his megaphone like a factory whistle, but it
was all lost. Unmarshalled cheers shook the
stand. Yells, shouts, slaps on the back,
frenzy. It was Regal's first chance to let loose.
The nervous tension was at the breaking point.
It needed just this play to act as a safety
valve. When Gaffney at last could get a
hearing, he yelled&mdash;"A Rah Rah for Mulvy."
With an enthusiasm that inspired the team
on the field, they yelled:</p>

<p>"Mulvy, Mulvy! Rah, Rah, Mul . . . vy!"</p>

<p>"Another," shouted Gaffney.</p>

<p>"Mulvy, Mulvy! Rah, Rah, Mul . . . vy!"</p>

<p>"Now one for Regal, whoop it up, boys."</p>

<p>"Regal, Regal, Rah, Rah, Regal!"</p>

<p>The ball was snapped back to Bob, who
gave it a kick that sent it right over the goal
for three points. Again pandemonium. Again
cheers. Stanley followers were beginning to
get nervous. 8 to 3 was not dangerous, but
it was the way Regal was going at it. "What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
a difference one man makes," was heard on
all sides.</p>

<p>The teams lined up again. Both were
playing at top speed. They swayed to and
fro. There were no slips, no mistakes. It was
give and take, with the results about even.
It kept on that way until the whistle blew and
the third quarter was over.</p>

<p>The Regal crowd occupied the short interval
cheering its team uninterruptedly. Stanley
did the same.</p>

<p>The whistle blew again, and the battle
was renewed. If Stanley could hold the score
as it was, the victory was hers. Out from her
side of the stands came the concerted yell,</p>

<p>"Stanley, hold! Stanley, hold! Stanley,
hold!"</p>

<p>And that was their game. They held well.
Eight minutes of the quarter had passed,
and it began to look as if nothing could get
through Stanley. It looked like her game.
Then something happened.</p>

<p>The ball was passed to Mulvy. With the
grace and speed of a hound, he made for the
enemy line. Hardly had he started when a
big Stanley player got right in front of him.
By clever dodging Frank got by him. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
just struck his stride when another opponent
dashed across his path ready to spring at
him. Frank came on full tilt, and just as a
plunge was made for him, he stopped short,
turned aside and the tackler went digging
into the ground.</p>

<p>The crowd was wild now. Only one man
stood between Mulvy and a touchdown, and
victory. The coach was pulling his hat to
pieces. The Regal followers were frantic with
anticipation.</p>

<p>But Stanley's best tackle was waiting for
Mulvy. He had seen how the other two were
fooled, and was ready for every emergency.
He was a cool, active big chap with lots of
football instinct. Frank knew him. He had
seen him play often. But on he ran like a
deer, his hair blown back by the wind, his
nostrils distended and his eyes aglow and
determined. As he got near the barrier, he
made as if he were going to keep right on.
He came at top speed to within a foot of the
tackle; then just as the tackle crouched low
and sprang at him, Frank fell sidewise to the
ground, rolled over, and before the tackle
could rise, jumped to his feet, ran at full speed
and crossed the line!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Lunacy was the word to describe what followed.
Madness seized the crowd. Hats in the
air, good hats. Fellows thumped one another,
jumped up and down, yelled and bawled and
screamed and cried. Hysteria was let loose.
Regal knew that the game was won. The
score now stood 9 to 8. As the teams were
playing, Stanley could not score again. Regal
took the ball and brought it down the field
to try for a goal. Bob kicked it, and it went
sailing just outside the mark. But no one
minded. The fellows rushed to position for
the continuation of the game. All the way
down to their formation, it was nothing but
"Bully Boy, Mulvy." "You saved the day,
Mulvy." "You're a brick, Mulvy."</p>

<p>And from the crowd it was, "Mulvy, Mulvy!
Rah, Rah, Mul....vy!" now from one
section of the Regal stand, now from another.</p>

<p>The whistle blew, the fight was on again.
Stanley made desperate efforts to regain the
lead. Once or twice they almost succeeded
in breaking through. The yell from their
followers now took another form. "Stanley,
gain! Stanley, gain! Stanley, gain!" They
tried hard. They kept on trying to the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
end. The whistle blew, the game was over,
Regal was Interscholastic Champion!</p>

<p>The noise that now broke out made all the
previous demonstration seem mild in comparison.
The Regal section of the stands was
one mass of frenzied humanity. Men, women
and boys yelled and slapped and thumped.
Anything that could make a noise was commandeered
and set in operation. It was
temporary lunacy. The tense strain of nearly
two hours let itself off in hysterically jubilant
celebration.</p>

<p>But the real frenzy was on the field. The
coach was fit to be caged. He yelled and
bawled and danced. He pummelled everybody
and everything within reach. All the reserve
players were cheering and howling, boy fashion.
The team itself was just one big satisfied
smile. Their joy was too great for expression.
They hugged one another. All of them tried
to hug Frank at once.</p>

<p>"O let up," he yelled. "This is worse than
the game." He tore himself loose. But not
for long. He was blocked everywhere. The
team surrounded him again, pitched him on
the shoulders of the stoutest two, spite of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
opposition, and marched off to the dressing
room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Mulvy? He's all
right! Who's all right? Mul....vy!" They
repeated that over and over again. As they
got near the stand, the crowd took it up, Gaffney
leading. "What's the matter with Mulvy?
He's all right! Who's all right? Mulvy!"</p>

<p>About a hundred Regal boys with Gaffney
at their head marched to Frank's home yelling,
"What's the matter with Mulvy? He's
all right! Who's all right? Mul....vy! Regal!
Rah, Rah, Regal!&mdash;Mul. . . .vy!"</p>

<p>They passed the rectory on their way to
Frank's house. Gaffney yelled out, "Here,
fellows, let's give a good one for Regal and
Mulvy." The cheer rang out,</p>

<p>"Regal! Regal! Rah, Rah, Regal. What's
the matter with Mulvy? He's all right! Who's
all right? Mul.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.vy! Regal! Regal! Rah,
Rah, Regal! Mulvy!"</p>

<p>Father Boone heard the yell and went to
his window. It was the first news he had of
the game. That yelling told him of victory,
even before he heard what they were shouting.
A defeated team goes home quietly. Not so
the victors. He was glad beyond expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Four of the boys on the team were graduates
of the Club. It was a great victory. But
what touched him particularly was that other
yell he heard. Regal was music to his ears,
but Regal and Mulvy! That meant that
Frank had done his share&mdash;more than his
share. As he got to the window, the crowd
was moving on. Every now and then he
caught the refrain, "What's the matter with
Mulvy? He's all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is all right, thank God," he said
to himself.</p>

<p>All through Parkville the crowd marched.
They were killing time until Frank should
show up. Then they had their plans. After
going to the High School, and giving the
Regal Rah, and the Mulvy Rah, they paraded
up and down the Avenue and over the cross
streets until everyone knew that Mulvy was
"all right." They waited and waited for
Frank. But no Frank showed up.</p>

<p>Finally Gaffney said, "I know that kid. He
has given us the slip. It's getting dark, fellows,
let's go up to his house and give him
a good yell and then scatter." So on they
marched to Frank's home. It was bedlam as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
soon as they got there. They yelled and yelled
until the whole neighborhood was out. That
was what they wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. Mulvy had just got home from his
office. Mr. and Mrs. Mulvy and Frank's
two elder brothers and his sisters came to the
windows to see what was up. They had not
heard of the result of the game. Mrs. Mulvy
had just finished telling how they sent for
Frank. What was their astonishment then
to hear the yell,</p>

<p>"Regal! Regal! Rah, Rah, Regal! Mul. . . .vy!
What's the matter with Mulvy? He's
all right! Who's all right? Mul. . . .vy!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mulvy looked suddenly at Mrs. Mulvy.
The big tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, dear, you should
be proud and happy?"</p>

<p>"I am. But you don't understand."</p>


<div class='center'><br />(VI)</div>

<p>About ten minutes later, when the crowd
had dispersed, Frank came quietly along the
Avenue and over the street to his home.
To his surprise the rooms were all lighted.
He opened the door and received such a warm
welcome that it took his breath away. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
rushed at him to shake him by the hand and
pat him on the back and kiss him. All but his
mother. His eyes ran over the room in search
of her. He saw her in the big arm chair, her
apron to her eyes, wiping away tears which
only he understood. He ran into her arms.
Neither said a word. They just embraced.
Then she kissed him on the forehead. "You
<i>are</i> all right, Frank," was all she said.</p>

<p>Of course, he told them all about the game.
But it was not until Dick and Ned and Tommie
came in to congratulate him that they
heard his part in it. Dick was a word painter,
and he drew such a picture of the game and
of a "certain player" in it that a certain
player blushed. But the father and mother
and the sisters and brothers of a "certain
player" started in all over again to maul
him, and tell that player what they thought
of him.</p>

<p>After dinner, with Tommy and Dick and
Ned all present, Frank had to go down to the
Club. He didn't want to&mdash;he knew how the
fellows would maul him. But he did feel that
Father Boone would expect him to be there.</p>

<p>The assembled fellows were hoping he would
drop in. The boys who had resigned were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
there, too. Frank's noble conduct had refuted
all charges against himself and the Club.
The crowd, knowing his quiet ways, feared
that he would not come. But when he arrived,
it was the same old thing over again.
Cheers, hand-shakes, howling, thumping, the
way that boys have of saying what they most
want to say.</p>

<p>After a while, he went upstairs. Father
Boone was expecting him. He entered smiling.
Father Boone was smiling too. But as they
looked at each other in silence, the strong man
and the brave boy saw tears in each other's
eyes. They grasped hands. And they looked,
as it were, each into the other's soul. For they
understood.</p>

<p>For a long time they sat in silence, pensive,
peaceful. At length Father Boone broke the
silence. It was no word of congratulation, no
reference to the game.</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, God's way is the best way."</p>

<p>Another spell of silence. This was broken by
Frank.</p>

<p>"I remember, Father, that you said life
was a mirage. I've been thinking of poor
Bill, and how he misunderstood us, and of
how you were mistaken in me, and how I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
misjudged you. We saw so much that really
was not there at all."</p>

<p>"It's good to realize that so early in life,
Frank. I've found from experience that most
trouble comes from misunderstanding. Why
God permits it, we do not know. I suppose it
is to try us."</p>

<p>"You know so much about life, Father, why
don't you write a book on it?"</p>

<p>"I may some day, Frank, and if I do I shall
put you in it and call it 'Mirage.'"</p>
